200616575	 We just returned from a stay at the Crowne Plaza. It was a great hotel in a very convenient location just a couple blocks from the McPherson metro station in Washington DC. Hotel room was beautiful and very comfortable. Staff was great. Great benefits came along with being a Platinum member of the Priority Club that I hadn't expected but LOVED. I would stay there again next time I am in the DC area. 14K restaurant attached was very good as well with a great happy hour (more like 4 hours) with food and drinks. All staff was great right down to a housekeeper who had the forethought to push the elevator button as she went by because she saw us coming. Way to make your guests feel special! 
200535663	 Stayed here for the cherry blossom festival run. Hotel was .8 miles from Washington monument. The hotel is located about one block from metro line and in a safe area. Very nice hotel but the standard king bed room was kind of small. The parking is by valet only and is $45. The walls seemed thin because you could hear everything in the hallway. They had several elevators but we're very small. The staff was very friendly, a nice restaurant on site, Starbucks on site, overall a very nice hotel and I would stay again. 
199820367	 I'm a Federal business traveler and it's great to find a small hotel that fits the allowable lodging cost, is a block away from Metro and a 10 block walk from my headquarters office. Perfect. The in-hotel Starbucks was a bonus. I know it's not their fault, but the tour groups were a pain and some of the younger ones were really loud. All in all, it's in a great location, outstanding staff and they treat the IHG Rewards members quite well. I'd recommend it and will probably be back if I have another trip to Washington. 
199479466	 It was great to have an internal Starbucks entry, for morning coffee pick-up before braving the springtime mornings in DC... :)<br/><br/>The room was spacious, and had pretty good wifi.<br/><br/>A pretty well-appointed gym, with quite a few machines and good weights.<br/><br/>Excellent service from the concierge. 
199454534	 The Crowne Plaza is a great looking small hotel. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Our corner room was definitely on the small side but we had a double exposure of windows and didn't feel cramped and really didn't spend much time in the room. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was nicely appointed. We were there for an event at the convention center which is a few short blocks away but the location is central to all the main sights. Bonus - Starbucks in the lobby. 
199016888	 Look, i travel all over the world. i like to review places, not in comparison with other places that may have a larger budget or a different vibe, but in comparison to what they COULD be. and the Hamilton crowne plaze hotel is a very nice hotel. from the time we pulled up to the door upon our arrival, to our departure the next day, we were treated as though we were very highly regarded and regular guests. We arrived on saturday afternoon, check-in was a breeze. elevators were just across the fairly small, but very nicely appointed lobby. elevators were a bit on the small side, but there were four of them, so it was all good. you do have to insert your room key to go up, but that only added to my sense of security.<br/><br/>STAFF: professional, courteous, observant, quick to assist.<br/><br/>ROOM: stayed on 14th floor; room was spacious, very clean, sufficient drawer space. our room was right beside the elevator which i had some trepidations about at first, but i couldn't hear even the slightest elevator rumble the whole time i was in the room. actually, i couldn't hear anything, not even traffic (of course, now, that coulda been due to being on the 14th floor or, more likely, the nice sleep pattern induced by the alcohol i'd imbibed just before bed).<br/><br/>BATHROOM: well lit, sufficient counter space at the sink for my hubby and i to share without getting in each other's way. super clean, very nice toiletries. water pressure in shower was good. facilities weren't super modern, but certainly modern enough. and anyway, those super-modern bathrooms always confuse me, so...<br/><br/>RESTAURANT AMBIENCE: conveniently, the hotel has a restaurant. and the food is above average. my only negative experiences were with the restaurant. the restaurant closes at 11pm and we got there at 10:40. when we walked in, there was loud rap music coming from the bar, but we had to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant. now, don't get me wrong. i love rap music, i do. and i understand that to get the full effect of rap (and other kinds of music, too), you gots to pump up the volume. but this was LOUD. and there was a group of about 10-15 young folks at the bar singing along at the top of their voices. ah, youthful exuberance. i didn't really mind that per se. but what's an older crowd supposed to do (there were 4 of us for dinner)? there were lots of empty seats in the restaurant, but nowhere to get away from the loud rap except OUTSIDE on their deck. people...it was cold. but they did have these above-the-head heaters out there that did a good job of keeping things warm, as long as i sat right under it. then, wouldn't you know it? as soon as we got seated and they brought us menus, the rap music went off, all the young people left and it was quiet in there. i wish the waiter had told us it was only a matter of a few minutes before things quieted down inside. we would have waited it out. <br/><br/>RESTAURANT FOOD: i ordered the chopped salad and their french fries. chopped salad good. french fries bad. the kitchen didn't even bother to put fresh fries in the fryer. they simply reheated whatever they had leftover back there. and the waiter could have at least told me that they weren't going to turn the fryer back on instead of pretending that everything was fine. this i actually found inexcusable and trifling on his part. he is supposed to be a liaison between the customer and the kitchen. but i got the distinct impression that all he was concerned about was seeing us hurry up and leave. he just wanted to get the hell outta there. the wine list was skimpy, with about 6-8 labels available as glasses for red and the same for white. you can also buy sparkling wine or champagne by the glass.<br/><br/>CHECKOUT: we checked out the next morning (i know, right? another quickie!) with only one glitch - they'd mistakenly charged us for valet parking. had to stand in line to address this with the desk, but it wasn't that long and the problem was corrected immediately with an apology and a smile. 
145931036	 Stayed 2 nites while in DC. Very central location within walking distance to tourist sightseeing and attraction, and pretty safe to walk back late at nite. Breakfast included was great and fabulous with smoked salmon and shrimp as part of full range of american buffet. Good quality settings in room and bathroom. <br/>Downsides - room size relatively small especially when you have 2 large luggage; executive lounge is closed from Fri-Sun (of all things on days when you have spare time to use it); probably the few hotels that still practice charging guests for wifi; add-on daily parking @$22++; valet only (+grautity) which takes away the spontaneity of traveling with a 15min wait for your car to be accessible. So considering all these, it is pretty pricey. But then what else do you expect from pricey DC. As the old saying - politicians and politics do not come cheap for the public purse. 
145605894	 We spent 5 great nights in the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in May 2012. The hotel is in a great location for sight seeing being only 10 minutes from the White House. We were upgraded to the executive level through my Priority Club platinum status which gave us a very comfortable spacious room. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Restaurant serve good tasty food, staff very friendly and efficient. Only downside executive area closed at weekend 
145557214	 Stayed for business - very good internet connection, bed is comfortable, breakfast is very rich with good selection (besides the coffee which was poor). Lunch menu is very basic, though.<br/>location was an advantage for my purpose (both business and some sightseeing).<br/>Very expensive, like the rest of the hotels in that area. 
145186819	 Great tourist stay location. EVERYONE was very friendly and courteous. Rooms were immaculate and bathroom was well lit, large, and very clean. Only downside is the windows/noise. The windows are either very old or just bad windows. Lots of night life sounds come in through the night and we were on the sixth floor. Didn't bother us as we were exhausted each night and passed right out in the very comfortable bed. The location is great, well within walking distance of the tourist spots and two blocks from most of the main subway lines. The bar staff was amazing and worked their butts off election night while we were there. Bottom line, for the price, this hotel far outperforms anything else. 
145171322	 Great location. Everything in DC is very close, a quick walk or short cab ride. We had our 12 year old son with us and it was great for him as well. Every time we went in or out of front door someone was there to open it I saw a review of this hotel and someone mentioned the park across the street and homeless people . The truth is at night they are not there and all over DC there are homeless people. Hotel was better than I had hoped. Would stay there again! 
144945895	 This hotel was maybe a good one but this is no more the case. One elevator only is working. Rooms are not that large. Wi-fi is not included. Guests are noisy.<br/>No need to ask a room overlooking the square, windows are so dirty that you cannot look outside.<br/>Food is just American. 
3195043	 Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for two nights over Valentine's weekend 2005. My wife and I had a great time and enjoyed the hotel. This hotel is an expectional value. <br/><br/>The postives are:<br/>Location, location, location<br/>Value<br/>Room size<br/>Cleanliness<br/>Service<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>It is downtown so noise level may be loud for some. It did not bother us.<br/>Valet Parking a bit pricey ($28), remember you are downtown.<br/><br/>Overall, excellant trip, we would stay here again.<br/> 
3167232	 I stayed at the Hamilton CP for one night (2/5-2/6). Upon arrival at about 3:30, the service was prompt and friendly, and the front desk accomodated my request for a smoking room (despite getting the room on Hotwire). The lobby was gorgeous, as was the exterior of the hotel. However, when I opened the door to our room, I found someone's luggage in the room, with clothes strewn about! I went downstairs, a bit frightened that I would be given a key to an occupied room! The front desk was wonderful. I was assured that this was not normal, and security was sent straight upstairs. I was upgraded to a king bed, and was given a complimentary breakfast in the restaurant. <br/><br/>The room was a bit small, but well-appointed and clean. Although the traffic may bother some, I felt right at home as I live in downtown Chicago. Actually, I found it to be relatively quiet! Earplugs are provided, as are a sleep mask and lavendar linen spray and a relaxation CD to help you rest. However, the bed was so comfortable, I could barely lay on it without passing out! (Please note that some may have allergies to the down pillows and comforter.) Plenty of towels and two fluffly, snuggly robes were found in the obviously newly renovated (and impressive) bathroom. In fact, the room was so comfortable that my boyfriend and I opted to come home early from our night out! <br/><br/>We did have the breakfast buffet at 14K. The service was attentive, and the buffet would be worth the price. As for the neighborhood, there are many homeless people in the park and around the old convention center. As in any city, its good to be familiar with your surroundings before wandering out alone at night. I never felt unsafe, but did opt to take a cab back to the hotel at night. The area surrounding the hotel basically is deserted after 5 on weekdays, and is not much busier on weekends.<br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay, and I would reccomend the hotel to someone who is familiar with DC, and really wants to get a good night's sleep!<br/> 
3160253	 My husband and I stayed in the Crowne Plaza for Valentine's Day weekend 2004. (I'm only writing this review now because I just found out about this site.) We got excellent rates on Hotwire, and were excited to stay at an establishment with a great reputation. However, we would have been better off staying at a Motel 6. <br/><br/>Since it was the off-season, it appeared that the hotel was in the midst of training all new staff. Though I confirmed the reservation with the hotel over the phone before arriving, they did not have our reservation in the computer when we arrived - thank goodness I had my confirmation print-out (warning to Hotwire customers!). I had also confirmed the room was non-smoking, but we still got stuck in a smoking room. And the hotel was full due to the holiday so we could not switch rooms. So we opened the window to air out the room, but there was no screen, and a nice, big hornet flew in immediately (bizarre since it was mid-Feb). <br/><br/>The next morning, we were awakened late by the sound of paper being pushed under our door. It was our quick check-out sheet explaining that we were expected to check-out within the next few minutes. But we were confirmed for the whole weekend. So I had to frantically call the front desk and fix the mistake. <br/><br/>That evening - Valentine's Day - we visited the restaurant in the hotel. I can honestly say, other than a trip to a national theme restaurant a few years ago, this was the worst service we have ever received. It took 45 minutes to get our drinks, another 30 minutes to get our salads, and so on. The menu was fixed, a great 'surf n turf' selection, but was all miserably overcooked.<br/><br/>The next morning we were ready to check-out, but despite being given a quick check-out sheet the day before, we were not given the sheet for the actual check-out day. So we stood in-line - with everyone else. Apparently, none of the guests had received their quick check-out info.<br/><br/>Again, I am willing to bet that this whole experience was so poor due to training issues. The hotel itself was beautiful, and so was the room. It's a good location, and the bell staff was extremely friendly. However, I will never again stay in this hotel, and would not recommend that anyone else does, lest s/he has the same experience. Because we saved so much money through Hotwire, I did not write a letter to the hotel management. However, even though we saved money, we did not save enough to warrant this bad experience.<br/> 
3019784	 I usually stay at Sheraton and/or Westin properties while on business, but this was quite a value so I thought I'd give it a shot. <br/><br/>I was in town for a conference held at the Convention Center (a few blocks away). I walked each time and felt very comfortable doing so. Starbucks was two blocks away from the hotel and had reasonable hours for business people. The Metro station is a block away -- very convenient for getting around.<br/><br/>Doormen/bellmen were incredibly polite and helpful. Front desk associates were great. Concierge seemed clueless (repeatedly) but I didn't rely on him that much -- just ask the bellman!<br/><br/>Room was very clean, the bed comfortable (with lots pillows). Bathroom was terrific -- granite counters and newly styled everything. The room was smallish but I expected that, given the city. Room's overall comfort was great for a single traveler.<br/><br/>I didn't order from the hotel restaurant, but ate at some terrific restaurants that were only a short cab ride or Metro stop away. Jaleo (spanish tapas), Raku (asian tapas in DuPont Circle), and a nice spot in Chinatown. There is a Subway, Quiznos, and Dominos very close to the hotel, and a large CVS drug store is much better than the closet they call a gift shop at this hotel.<br/><br/>I loved my stay here and won't hesitate to use it for future DC trips, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it...<br/> 
2972609	 My boyfriend and I decided to book a last minute trip on HotWire and take the short flight to D.C. for the New Year's weekend. We lucked out and got this hotel as an option. I did a little research, looked at the reviews on Trip Advisor and decided that Crowne Plaza looked elegant, accessible, and centrally located. I was pleasantly surprised to see I was correct. The service was very good. Our non-smoking room smelled of smoke and we were immediately moved to the room next door after alerting the front desk. The rooms were nicely decorated and the bed is amazingly comfortable. The closets are a bit small, but were just fine for two. A great touch on New Year's Eve was complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries served in the lobby. I highly recommend the hotel if you are looking for a comfortably elegant hotel in downtown D.C.<br/> 
2972081	 My family and I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza on New Year's Eve. Everyone was very courteous and helpful. We arrived early around 11 AM and were able to check right in. I had a queen room with a view (I wouldn't call it a view since it is of a park full of homeless people) My parents had a king room. Everything people said about the beds are correct, they are definetly the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on in a hotel. The location is great we walked everywhere we went. The white house is only 4 blocks away. The rooms are huge but I think they are a great size. All in all the trip went perfectly. Hope this helps. I would stay there again in a heartbeat.<br/> 
204485542	 We had three nights in adjoining rooms in the HCP - great to have the children near but not share a room. The room was lovely and comfortable, although I really don't get the collection of bolsters and cushions that have to be removed from the bed to sleep. <br/><br/>The room was clean and quiet, and there was a lovely aromatherapy kit available for use. <br/>The breakfast buffet was delicious, with very fresh fruit and a wide variety of cooked items which we enjoyed very much, especially as it was included in the price of our room.<br/><br/>Two small gripes - the quote we received from the hotel didn't include tax - as a non-American I found this very annoying that our bill was $100 more than the quote because of this tax. It doesn't seem a hard thing to either mention the sales tax rate or include it. <br/>Secondly as a Brit, it was a pain not to be able to make tea in our room. There was a great coffee machine which offered green tea and coffee but no way to get hot water except room service.<br/><br/>That said, I would go back to this hotel as the staff were lovely and helpful, the location is great and the rooms are very nice. It's not cheap, but at cherry blossom time it was peak season, and was a good experience.<br/><br/>Another plus point was the proximity to the metro - only about a block and a half which made it easy getting in from the airport by public transport. 
204298794	 We had just one night to stay in DC before heading to stay with family in Virginia. The hotel was perfectly located, and the room was elegant and comfortable. Check in was quick, even though we were quite early, and we were able to leave our bags and hit the city. Enjoyed this hotel and we'll definitely go back when we can. 
204177195	 I stayed here for four nights, and it was the first time I had ever travelled alone. The check in was a drama- I got there and they said I could check it at 1pm. I'd had a long flight and was tired, but I sat in the bar and waited. At 1pm, they said it would be another half an hour. However, I couldn't check in until 4:30pm. This really annoyed me, and it wasn't a great start to my stay here. The elevators were also broken, and stopping at every floor. This meant the lobby was packed full of people, and it took ages getting up to the floor.<br/><br/>The room itself was lovely, and the hotel was walking distance to a lot of things… there was a park next door to the hotel where a lot of homeless guys would say pretty nasty things as you walk past, but that isn't the hotels fault! You do have to pay for Wi-Fi, and it's about $13 a day… for a hotel that you're paying a lot for, that's a lot! You'd expect free Wi-Fi. The room service menu was quite small, but there were some nice places to eat around there.<br/><br/>My favourite thing about this hotel was the bed- I have NEVER slept in a comfier bed in my life! I don't know how they do it, but I had amazing nights sleep every night!<br/><br/>I would recommend this hotel, but I don't know that I'd stay here again. 
203913397	 First trial to Washington DC....we stayed 2 nights at this FANTASTIC hotel. From the minute we arrived, staff were kind and very helpful. It took a few minutes to check in, and it was only 11am-bonus, the room was ready. Beautiful room. Spacious and very clean. Beds very comfy indeed. We booked the breakfast for both mornings-delish and set us up for the day. We booked the Big Bus Tour via the helpful concierge. Drinks and food in the bar were lovely.<br/>The hotel is situated near the White House. near to Macy's too :-). <br/>Washington is a wonderful city, and we WILL be back.....<br/>FAB!! 
203753624	 Location - fine. The rooms are small but extremely comfortable.Reluctance to replace towels but the cleanliness was exemplary.Confusion over VIP lounge is it fee or part fee? How can it be VIP when you pay for drinks!! People popped out of the lifts - helped themselves without any check and dashed back into the lifts. Ridiculous and poorly managed !! <br/>Bar area excellent and well managed - food good 
203529540	 <br/>We stayed 3 nights &amp; were checked in effeciently. We did have problems waiting for the elevators &amp; when one finally did come it would randomly stop for no-one on every other floor, but to the hotels credit they did have someone there trying to fix it. There was a really unpleasant smell coming from the bathroom drains when we returned back several times. We also recieved a charge for a bottle of water that we had brought ourselves &amp; put in our fridge. This was removed when we told reception but we feel that this shouldnt have been added in the first place. The room was spacious with good amenities but there was a sipper bottle &amp; other items left from previous guests under the bed. For the price paid I think there must be better options. 
136937806	 First off..pulling up to the hotel was pretty simple..just park in front of hotel and the valet takes over..check in was super easy considering we were a party of 8 and arrived very early. Front desk was awesome and allowed us to check into one room as the other was not ready..so we stored our luggage in that room and hit the streets. Location: simply the best..14th street is by far the easiest access to the Mall..go by taxi and it will be under 10 dollars anywhere in the downtown DC area. Rooms: we booked the executive floor and we were thrilled with the decor and the view! Rooms are alittle small but then again it is downtown DC..bathroom was huge! Staff: Anna is the conceige and she is the hidden gem in this hotel...love her..she talked us into a DC twilight evening tour bus and that was the best decision we ever made. We have been to DC before but this tour was amazing (cheers to DEEDEE)our tour guide. I highly recommend this tour and though alittle costly $160 for 4 adults was the best money we spent. Back to hotel..this is a quaint bouquet style hotel that puts customers first and more importantly the focus on details is what sets this hotel apart from the &quot;box hotels&quot;. If your looking for huge cold hotel that will never recongize you then this sweetie is not for you...Instead I would suggest this truly art-deco, intimate and friendly hotel...oh and please do the breakfast buffet..OMG the best! While there try anothe suggestion from the hotel and eat at PJ Clarks..med range price with the best food that satisfied all our group...all in all a great trip..thanks Hamilton staff! from room 1239 
136933596	 Every member of the staff was excellent and the hotel is in a great location, that was the only positive from our experience. Our room was very dirty, called the front desk and someone was sent right up to clean it. She cleaned the bathroom and ran the vacuum, but I still found an earring on the floor after she left and there was dust all over the furniture which I did not initially notice when I called. We had a room with a view of the park, but with it was alot of noise from the street. That didn't bother me or my child, but it kept my husband awake. I have been double billed for this room and nobody seems to know why or is taking any action to fix it. I left a message for someone in accounting last week, no return call. I spoke to a woman on Friday who agreed that I was double billed and that she would look into it and call me right back, have yet to hear anything and still no refund to my credit card. The restaurant was great, a little pricey, but food and service was outstanding. This hotel has a lot of potential due to its location and excellent staff, but they need to make drastic changes before I would even consider returning. 
136921927	 We stayed at the Hamilton Crowne on a quick family trip to DC in August 2012. The room was excellent value as we were able to raher confortably fit our family of four into a room with double beds for our single-night stay. The hotel is classy and stylishly funished, although the bathroom was rather small and a bit dated. Aside from value, the biggest selling point for us was location, as the hotel is just one block from the McPherson Sq subway station and within easy walking distance from the White House. Staff was very friendly and breakfast more than adequate. We would defnitely use the hotel again. 
136524865	 My partner and I stayed at this hotel this past weekend (08/04) and we had no clue what to expect. Being a Executive for a large hotel chain I know that everyone has a different idea of what service standards, cleanliness, and locations mean to them. We were visiting Washington, DC for the NO H8 Campaign photo shoot and we only needed accommodations for one night. I had went on Priceline.com to book the room and since I work in the hotel industry I knew to call direct to the hotel to confirm that Priceline booked the correct accommodations. SURPRISE they did not. I called and spoke to Daniel with in-house reservations at The Hamilton and he was so kind and courteous and corrected the situation immediately. Daniel has an outstanding grasp of customer service. (Thank You Daniel) <br/>Once we arrived on property we were greeted by the valet staff which were so friendly and did not just welcome us to the hotel but also to our Nation's Capital. Nice touch! We proceeded inside to the lobby and it was as beautiful as the pictures. We were guided to the check-in desk and our room was not ready. However, being in the industry all the extra smiles and welcoming comments had me so distracted that I responded &quot;no problem&quot;. The guest service agent Veronica R was so nice and upgraded us to a Jr. Suite; however, we stated we needed two beds so she put us in a newly renovated room. One word to describe it...WOW! The rooms was on the 11th floor and was so beautiful it was AMAZING! The General Manger should take a bow because I know the cost of capital improvements on a large hotel and all I can say is what a great job the GM is doing. The design is contemporary and comfortable with plenty of seating and the room layout is perfection. We did encounter some slight maintenance issues the A/C did not work when we got to the room they attempted to fix it, but later in the afternoon we had to call them back because A/C was not cooling the room. Maintenance on the second return to the room replaced the A/C and we were very pleased. I give maintenance an A+++ for their quick resolution to the issue. At one point during our stay my partner went to get ice and the ice machine on our floor was not in service but again the incredible staff there stepped it up again - the housekeeper on our floor volunteered to go and get ice for us from another floor. WOW I was taken back by their commitment to customer service! The Executive Housekeeper should be commended for Outstanding Training of the housekeeping staff.<br/>The hotel has renovations going on in rooms and the lobby but they are so respectful of their guest that they work at night as to not take away from the beauty of this hotel. The location is to me the BEST IN Washington D.C. My experience this past weekend was one that is unmatched by any other hotel in Washington D.C. My partner and I will praise and recommend this location to everyone we know that is going to visit D.C. <br/>My partner and I have decided that when we return to visit D.C. we will only book at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza.....they were flawless in executing their service standards, cleanliness, customer service and hospitality.<br/><br/>A++++++++++++ on everything you do and please continue to RAISE THE BAR in hospitality, because you definitely know what you are doing. We look forward to our visit in September and I can't hardly wait to come back. 
136512135	 a very conveniently located hotel - just a short walk from the metro station McPherson Sq. unfortunately for me, the hotel was under the construction/renovation so none of the usual amenities were available. I was informed that every day from 10 to 5 there will be roof workers that may appear in the windows - mine was there at 8am. There was no cold or hot water in the shower for a couple of hours in the morning.<br/>My Platinum/ambassador profile explicitly states As far away as possible from the elevators and ice machines. I even notified the staff in advance that this will be my birthday stay. I got no upgrade, and a room next to the elevators. I had to ask for the breakfast coupon, my Internet could not be free. a special card that gives one a free appetizer (since there was no club room) had to be asked for again. Late check out turned out to be also a hassle.<br/>the staff (with the exception of Vanessa, the HR lady) was preoccupied with something else, unattentive, dismissive and plainly withdrawn. the same should be said about the 14k staff - none of them looked happy to be employed by this place, they were visibly just plodding through.<br/>the room decor is good, and the linen are very high quality, as are the towels. Bathrobe though should be replaced as it is too old and too worn out. The air-conditioning unit was quite loud, and the TV set was deliberately modified to disallow any external connections - so one could not connect iPad or iPods to it.<br/>for shame, though - as the hotel has everything it needs structurally and technically. But the staff needs to be re-hired so that people who can show a much more needed motivation and interest in guests' well-being can bring the service at this hotel to a higher level. 
136491366	 My only complaint about my entire experience was the cost of parking...but, I recognize that parking is at a premium in D.C. so I willingly paid it. <br/><br/>The staff was wonderful, efficient, and friendly. My room was awesome and it was supplied with everything I could possibly have needed. I love that it's a historic hotel...it had that old-fashioned charm that I adore.<br/><br/>The hotel is so well located! It's in the nicest part of D.C. and is so close to the Metro and several great restaurants and attractions. <br/><br/>I had a great stay and hope to return soon! 
170956187	 The hotel staff was very pleasant and accommodating, including a request to change rooms (got a better one with a nice park view) and our request for 2 PM check out was easily and quickly granted. Room was well decorated and bed was very comfortable. Location was convenient to metro and walking. Bathroom was nicely sized and arranged. A real Starbucks in the lobby was also a nice add. Breakfast average but sufficient with nice seating inside and out. Would stay there a again. 
170450579	 Not sure how many hours the Concierge puts in, but he seemed to always be there and VERY helpful! I'd go back just because of him. Washington, D.C. does not have enough signs for first time visitors. Location of this hotel is pretty good, close to metro subway, and there is a bus stop right around the corner. We found it cheap enough sometimes just to get a cab back to the hotel instead of trying to determine if we were taking the correct subway. We don't have those here in the South!. Hotel was clean and room size adequate for the time we spent in there. The upgrade to the 3rd floor facing the park wasn't really an upgrade. There were trees blocking the view which was fine b/c on weekends the park seemed to fill up with homeless people. Our first night, Thursday, was not restful. We could hear people laughing, talking out on the street and motorcycles passing by. We found out there are a few clubs a couple blocks down so guess they were having a good time. All in all we felt safe, the area was clean, and we had no problems walking or getting to transportation to go anywhere we wanted to go. The homeless kept to themselves and never once asked us for anything near the hotel or park. I just wonder where they go during the week days b/c the numbers are drastically less than on Saturdays. 
170446730	 Had a lovely room overlooking the nearby park. Beautiful rooms, everything you need at hand, good room service and Internet connection. A location that you walk to most things from. Great for a business stay. 
170411243	 The rating system on Trip Advisor doesn't always lend itself to awarding the right amount of 'stars'. I'd go with 'good' if it were available!!<br/><br/>Reception staff - a little offhand.<br/><br/>The room - quite small, comfortable bed, good pillows, small(ish) bathroom (shower over bath as usual!).<br/><br/>The aircon in the room was dreadful - it seems there are two systems - the main 'house' system that's permanently operating (and quite audible) and an 'in room' unit that made us wonder whether we weren't still at Reagan airport!! Atrocious noise!<br/><br/>No free wi fi anywhere in the hotel - there's a Starbucks attached to the hotel, but they're not allowed to provide free wi fi either!<br/><br/>Out of four (or perhaps 5?) elevators, it seemed that there were only ever 2 working at any one time, resulting in quite long waits. 
170370736	 If you want to be in the heart of Washington, D.C, then this hotel is perfect. Within walking distance of the major attractions, including The White House and Smithsonian Institution. We stayed five days the week of July 15, 19 to 22 had a room overlooking the park which was a plus. Our room was quiet and service was excellent. The staff were very helpful. <br/><br/>Filmon 
170055735	 Really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The location was great, just a few blocks from the Smithsonian. But it was the staff that really made this place great. Being in town for work, and on my own, I was a bit hesitant about going out on my own for dinner. I ended up eating at the hotel restaurant multiple times, and the wait staff was excellent. The front desk folks were also wonderful, incredibly friendly and helpful, I would stay there again in a second. 
2430196	 (This hotel is also known as the Hamilton Crown Plaza). My business meeting was at this hotel and I stayed here not knowing anything about it. The location was pretty good for me, near the McPherson Metro stop at 14th and K Streets. The lobby and rooms look to have been renovated in the last couple of years and are pretty nice. The staff overall didn't seem very well trained in customer service. Front desk didn't have information on the metro times and couldn't even give me change when I tried to pay by traveler's check. The hotel lacked even a small work-out room. This hotel has a lot of potential. It is a handsome historic property. With the right management, it could be a interesting place for repeat visits.<br/> 
2429912	 Recently visited DC and stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. The hotel's approach to customer service was the same as we encountered in the rest of DC.<br/><br/>It seems that DC has a captive audience of visitors so people working in front line customer service roles don't seem to be bothered about things like &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot;. Never mind advanced customer service like smiling or even trying to go out of their way to help.<br/><br/>As for the taxi drivers. Rip off merchants. The number of cab drivers who seemed to have given thier credit card machines to other drivers seemed more of a co-incidence. If you don't want to take credit cards, say so, don't advertise Amex, Visa et al on your cab and then protest when someone offers it.<br/><br/>As for the Crowne Plaza. This is an ok hotel. However, it is a really, really poor example of the Crowne Plaza brand. As a top tier member of Priority Club I had the worse service I have ever had at any of thier properites world wide. It was not that it was bad per se, it was just totally indifferent. <br/><br/>None of the staff seemed to be at all bothered about anything. Need an umbrella - &quot;you can buy one in the shop&quot;. That kinda sums it up. True you could buy one in the shop, but....<br/><br/>I'm going back to DC as I stop-over for one night and I'm not bothering with the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. Which I think says it all. Also I'll be asking the cab drivers in advance about credit cards and I'm using the Shuttle Bus on the way back to the airport rather than a cab.<br/> 
2321933	 Very nice hotel. The staff were all very polite and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to my family and friends, but if you go, you should be sure to ask for a &quot;quite&quot; room, meaning one that faces the back of the hotel. The hotel is located on a noisy intersection and if your room faces the front of the hotel, you will hear the traffic ans sirens at any hour.<br/> 
2275130	 This is nice hotel with excellent rates. The only draw back is that the rooms are small. The service is excellent. Great location!!<br/> 
2270268	 Our stay was dreadful. Will never stay here again! We used Priority Club points and are very disappointed that we wasted them on this place.<br/><br/>Only Pro: Between 1 to 3 miles from the usual DC sites (Smithsonian, White House, etc). <br/><br/>Cons: Rude staff by everyone from the managers all the way down to the wait staff. Very small room with no counter space in the bathroom and a dining room style chair for the only seat besides the desk. Valet and the Bellman are right on your coat tails as if you can not carry one bag to your room, and you have no idea where your car is taken to for the $26 fee for parking. The in-hotel restaurant is outlandishly expensive and don't expect to have anything complimentary during your stay. They even ran out after two $4.50 domestic beers we decided to splurge on, and only had more expensive drinks to offer in their place. We stayed on a Sunday night and everything is closed nearby because we were told we were in the financial district. And we thought they advertised for tourists to the DC sites. The park view we had was only a better view of the bums that reside there. The service at breakfast was the worst I have ever had and the food was only mediocre at best for its $30 price tag. The amenities they advertise are non existent and I can't see any reason to stay here ever again!<br/> 
222276679	 I recently stayed a this property which is located at a great DC location, almost behind the White House.<br/>To find it was a bit difficult since I was searching for a Crowne Plaza sign and the only thing I saw was a &quot;Hamilton&quot; sign. That made me go once around the block for no reason.<br/>Once we checked in, the first surprise was the valet parking rate. I managed to park the car on the parking at the corner for a third of the price charged at the hotel.<br/>Other than that the hotel is very good. The personnel is attentive and always ready to help.<br/>The property is clean and the sleeping quality is great.<br/>I would definitely go back there while in DC (and park the car myself once again). 
222031856	 Stayed for a couple of nights in August.<br/><br/>Location: very central to DC attractions - 10-15min walk to Mall and the Whitehouse. Metro station one block away.<br/><br/>Check-in: not the best experience as being a platinum member, there was no complimentary upgrade and we were given a room with the view being the air vent! We went back to reception and changed to a different room.<br/><br/>Room: clean and good size room for city location.Shower over bath was ok. No view as our room was facing the other side of the hotel (at least not the air vent!) Free wifi with IHG membership.<br/><br/>Breakfast: good quality food but limited choice, expensive if not included in room rate ($21 + tax/ service)<br/><br/>Overall: good hotel, would use again when next in DC. 
220873422	 WOW, we chose this hotel for it's great location and did we pick it right!!! Nestled next to a great park that hosts local food trucks, we thought we hit the lottery! Plus, every thing you might need is just steps away - including the sites of DC! Safe, clean neighborhood and positioned just right just a few steps from the Metro made getting to the hotel a breeze and budget friendly! <br/>The lobby is elegant, front desk staff professional and helpful. The room was near perfect and very spacious with two double beds, coffee maker, refrigerator and flat screen TV. Nice linens and comfy bed made returning after a day of sightseeing pleasurable! Someone put lots of thought into the details when designing the rooms. High end fixtures and furnishing were used which made our extended stay very pleasurable. Best loved feature? The window treatments!!! Not a speck of light indicated it was morning! When visiting DC, this hotel is PERFECT!!!!! 
220844203	 This is the type of hotel I like: small, elegant, well situated, good food. Sadly, though, the service isn't at all up to par with the surroundings. It was very difficult to get internet service in any of our rooms (we had 4), and it took about 10 hours to get a plumber to fix a running toilet. However, I did leave several items of clothing in my closet at check-out, which I only discovered a number of days later. When I contacted the hotel, the wonderfully honest housekeeper had turned in the items to lost and found, and the hotel mailed them to me. I was very grateful. 
220759431	 I spent 4 nights for a business trip this past week. <br/>The location is convenient to the McPherson Square Metro stop, super easy to get there from Reagan National Airport. <br/>There are restaurants and other stores within easy walking distance. I walked to Whole Foods for supplies a couple of times and the mini fridge in my room made for easy breakfasts as I had early start times each morning. <br/>I used the fitness center several times, the equipment is new and in good condition.<br/>My room was on the 12th floor, no view (a next door office building), but it was spotless, bathroom included. I had an executive room, so I think they're a bit larger than a standard room, with a small couch and desk and chair.<br/>The Keurig in my room was appreciated, but the Green Mountain Coffee brand on offer is awful.<br/>Housekeeping did a great job in my room, and I happily returned to a spotless room every afternoon.<br/>I needed wi-fi for work, and the signal was strong with only one hitch with connecting on my second day.<br/>Elevators are slow and on the small side, but I kept that in mind and always gave myself a bit of extra time when leaving. It's a fair trade for having an older building with some character.<br/>As I'm a Priority Club member they didn't bat an eye when I asked for a late (2 PM) check out on Wednesday.<br/>Overall, definitely a keeper if I return to D.C. and need to be on the orange or blue line. 
220679653	 My hubby and I decided to head to DC for a short babymoon before our first child arrives in November. The Hamilton aloud us to check in about an hour early which was great. The room was large, clean and spacious. Bathroom also gets two thumbs up. It was centrally located, only 1 block from the Metro.<br/><br/>The only complaint was the elevators from the lobby up took some extra time. <br/><br/>Also the hotel didn't do anything to recognize our babymoon... 
137892277	 The location was perfect. It is convenient to everything. The rooms in DC are all small, but the room was adequate. You will feel pampered. We were there just for a quick overnight. I was able to book with points. 
137886459	 This is a gorgeous hotel and in a great location. The staff is very friendly, the decor is powerful but inviting at the same time, and we always love staying here. The only reason I did not give a 4 or 5 star review is that one, the rooms are much smaller than I expected. They are well-appointed and comfortable, but small. Two, we had stayed here many times in the past two years and the rate used to $119. I understand that it is a beautiful hotel, is right at City Center, etc. but now for the rate to be in the mid-200's....well, I just think it's a little excessive. I know it's location, location, location, but for what you get and the size of the room, I think the rate will send us elsewhere and it's sad because we love this hotel. 
137828756	 Some friends and I booked rooms at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for an extended weekend vacation, and it was the perfect choice. The hotel's location (14th and K Streets) is in the heart of the city and just a block away from the McPherson Square Metro station. Rooms are small, but nicely appointed with decent sized bathrooms. The beds are super comfortable. The street noise is not very noticeable, although my friends did say they heard some noise coming from the alley on Monday morning and a fire station is about a block away (with engines coming and going). The front desk staff is very helpful with directions, hailing a cab, etc. Parking is pretty expensive ($38/day), although the deal we found on Travelzoo cut that in half. The deal was amazing ($99/night). I would definitely go back at that price. Didn't get a chance to try out the hotel restaurant, but there's a really cool place across the street that sells crepes with either meats and cheeses or dessert items. Very good and quite reasonable. There's a Starbucks that's part of the hotel, but didn't get there either. Hotel was under renovation when we were there (mid-August 2012), and the hotel's fitness center was closed. Hotel patrons were invited to use the fitness center at a nearby hotel, but I found a jog around the White House much more interesting. 
137786428	 The Hamilton Crown Plaza, though undergoing a bit of renovation, was pleasant, comfortable, and convenient to all prime tourist destinations. easy walk to many places, or inexpensive cab ride. though parking was simplified by a drive-up to the front door valet system, it was pricey (but i guess most downtown hotels have to be). very cooperative in accommodating a big lunch party - they even allowed individual ordering and checks! only one negative: the coffee provided in the room for the coffee maker was truly dreadful - unless you like your coffee very, very weak! was grateful for the starbucks in the lobby! 
137778753	 I booked this hotel near the US capitol attractions. It is a boutique hotel so please be advised that means small european sized rooms. The location of the hotel doesn't offer much light but if you go out you will be within minutes of many of the tourists attractions. Room service was ok. 
137613207	 Friendly concierge staff, clean room and comfortable bed. Walking distance to many eateries and pharmacies around, Metro is just 1 block away (McPherson). But do bear with the hotel appearance, as renovation going on. Attached Starbucks to the hotel is another plus. 
26692354	 I have stayed at a wide variety of hotels over the years, so I have a lot to compare. First, this hotel is in a great location and everything is easily accesible. The hotel itself was a huge disappointment. The photos make it seem sooo much more luxurious. We had a 400 sq. ft room, which sounded big, but it isn't. I asked for a refrigerator for the room and was told it would cost $15 per day. I needed for medical reasons--they didn't care. <br/><br/>It seems like they charge you for everyting. $.50 cents per minute to use their computer in the business center. You have to tip for everything, so plan on adding about $50 for a four-night stay. That's in addition to the $33 per day parking. The bathrobe in my room was dirty and there was only 1, when we had three guests. The maid didn't do a very good job of resupplying us either. <br/><br/>The concierge was not around during the day and seemed like he didn't want to do much other than chat. I heard him tell someone they didn't need reservations at Old Ebbitt Grill--get real.<br/><br/>The lounge, 14K was awesome. Great atmosphere and service.<br/><br/>Considering the price of this hotel, I really expected a little more luxury. I would have to think twice about staying here again or recommending it. <br/><br/>They also didn't acknowledge that I was a priority club member. 
26667253	 This is a great hotel - ideal location, good price, wonderful service and lovely room. The hotel is in a great spot - was very easy to get and from for our meetings. The staff is very welcoming throughout the entire visit and were attentive to our needs. The room was nicely appointed - gave that historic/classic feeling you want when staying in a town like DC. The restuarant has been remodeled since the last visit and it looks awesome. The food, drinks and service were great! Defnitely recommend 14K for Happy Hour and dinner. Overall we had a great stay and will definitely stay at the Hamilton again! 
25405437	 My daughter and I came to DC for the weekend and stayed at the The Hamilton Crowne Plaza. We can't think of one negative thing to say. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean, comfortable and very affordable. I appreciated the extra pillows and blankets in the room. We had dinner at the hotel's restaurant, &quot;K Street Lounge and Restaurant&quot; on Friday night and the food and service was terrific. We intend to come back to DC and will definitely stay at the Hamilton again. 
23831657	 For Obama's Inauguration, we stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. We booked everything through Travelocity, and on arrival we got the “Travelocity room,” 3rd floor, next to the elevator, looking out on the HVAC equipment, but well decorated , spotlessly clean. It was freezing in the room, so we called the desk and they sent someone up after our second call. The whole heat unit had been shut off; a simple switch was the fix we needed. There were ear plugs and a poncho (in case of rain or snow) on the bed, and an Obama lapel pin as a gift. Each day another collectible was on the desk, a glass, golf balls, a tote bag, all with the inaugural seal. There was a Starbuck’s off the lobby, a gift stand set up in the lobby with Obama paraphernalia, a fur sale in what may have once been a meeting room. It was so well located, we were lucky to have been there. The greatest part of the hotel was the staff, beaming smiles, helpful service, we did not want for a thing. After the first day we realized the value of being on the inside, no traffic noise, and on the 3rd floor, taking the stairs with the elevators very busy at all hours. There was a whine from the HVAC equipment outside, but it didn’t bother us and I used the ear plugs to sleep. I just can’t say enough about the people who worked in the hotel! From the hard-working bar &amp; restaurant crew to the unobtrusive room attendants, it was perfect and enjoyable all around. I would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting DC for business or pleasure, especially it’s convenient location to the White House and if you're hardy, to the Mall and Smithsonian Museums. 
23261220	 This was my second visit to the Hamilton Crowne Plaza and the stay was perfect, the staff were helpful and the food was great. 
23256571	 Walked in and asked for a quiet room. Front desk very accommodative. Room quiet (though not many off main street) and well laid out. Good room darkening shades. Restaurant excellent for breakfast. If you are Choice Club member, make sure you let them know. Valet parking only and though you have access to car, it is not easily accessible - but valet staff will be helpful and walk with you to your car (about 1 block away). Very convenient to White House and easily walkable to mall if you like to walk. 
180866308	 Excelent location, nice room. But charging for the internet and for each device? I was charged twice for using my iPhone and MacBook on the same day!!!<br/>Any way the room was clean, nice bed, and big. There was a constant noice on the shafts during night. 
180858620	 This is a very nice hotel a few blocks north of the White House and the National Mall. The subway is one block south and the stop for the circulator bus is across the street. The room was a good size with a sitting area and desk. The room also had a mini fridge which was great for drinks and snacks. The safe was a good size and fit all the electronics in it . The bed was very comfortable with nice fluffy pillows. The bathroom was very vice but lacked counter space. I would definitely would stay here again. 
180769173	 As a IHG gold member I got an upgrade to the executive floor. The room was on the 14th floor which is quieter I understand. The executive lounge staff are not very engaging and were more interested on the TV programme than their job. The refreshments were lacklustre and unimaginative. However the reception staff at check in were great so was the concierge service. Overall it was a pleasant enough stay except for one day when they missed cleaning the room altogether and had to get housekeeping to sort that out. I usually expect better form a Crowne Plaza/ The location of the hotel was great. Short walk to the National mall and the major monuments and museums. 
180611766	 Location and ambiance in this hotel is great, but unfortunately, the in room air handling units turn on and off very noisily and frequently. I woke up several times throughout both nights of my stay here and each time noticed that the unit had just turned on. In addition, my stayover included a Saturday and the street noise from the nearby nightlife was pretty loud at 2 and 3 am. If i choose to stay here again i will need to bring earplugs - perhaps the hotel could make these available to guests (probably not a strong selling point for the hotel but, they're needed). 
180583565	 Stayed here just a single night for business. Nice rooms and a perfect location. Service was excellent too I thought - reception and concierge couldn't do enough. The hotel is not brand new but dollar for dollar there may not be a better value hotel in DC. 
180516268	 This was a nice hotel, the rooms were classy, the beds were really good and the shower and bathroom very good.<br/>The service was great as was the bar and restaurant although we only used them twice…….but the coffee sux! I cannot get used to American percolated coffee at the best of times, but this was poor. We sent it back. What’s wrong with have a barista and making real coffee??<br/>But that was the worst of it, so I highly recommend this hotel 
153174943	 We (2+2) stayed in a executive room with 2 queen beds on the 14th floor. Not a huge room but perfect for our purpose. Got a really good deal so can not complain about the price<br/><br/>The good:<br/> -nicely decorated rooms<br/> -efficient and helpful front desk staff<br/> -comfortable beds and enough pillows<br/> -got a room on 14th floor, so we were not disturbed by any noise from the streets<br/> -free bottles of water and a nespresso-type-of-machine for coffe and tea<br/> -ordered delicious cobb sallad from room-service for a resonable price<br/> -great breakfast buffe on weekends in the restaurant (seemed to be popular among locals)<br/> -walking distance to Smithsonians and White House<br/><br/>The bad<br/> -outrageous priced wi-fi - PER DEVICE! Come on, it is 2013!!! This is why you will not get a five from me!!<br/> -lifts underdimensioned for the hotel, too few and too slow<br/> -cleaning not very efficient, bathrobes still on floor, all amenities not being replenished<br/> -only a thin blanket with linen provided, expected something more comfortable (it is winter)<br/> -in the best area for museums etc but not for a nice stroll on town (better be closer to Georgetown then) 
153148341	 For what they charge (yes, I know DC is pricey) I expected better quality. Yes - hotel is refurbished national landmark with all the accompanying ambience and quirks (like very small elevator cars). Staff is professional, friendly, accomodating. But $12/day for internet is ridiculous. Mattress was not comfortable and room was cold until we pulled down the inner black out shades, which meant no natural light at all. Bedding seemed &quot;cold&quot; - fluffy comforters would have been nicer. Toilet was very sluggish - needed to call for plunger (a hassle, but they quickly brought it). Room with two double beds wasn't much bigger than the beds. However, location is great - short walk to metro (on blue and orange), reasonable walk to the Mall, White House, etc and some great and classic restaurants nearby. Good closet space. On 5th floor did not experience the 14th St noise that others report. 
153125614	 I spent one night here for a conference and am very glad it wasn't longer. The staff overall was great and the restaurant was good but there was so much noise. The first room I had was right *behind* the elevator and thus you heard the elevator every time it went by. I requested to be moved, which I promptly was. The second room had a problem with the lock and it took almost 1/2 hour for someone to get me in the room. Then, all night long, about 3-4 times an hour, there was a loud noise, like someone dropped something. It came from behind the shower wall, so I don't know if it was the water pipes or what, but it was loud. I slept awfully, never mind the sirens. 
153112545	 My husband &amp; I have stayed more than 5 times at this property. From the start with speaking with the hotel operator to check-in was wonderful. The staff is friendly &amp; helpful. When we arrived the front desk always upgrade us to a junior suites- these suites are in the corner, but very spacious, clean &amp; the beds are comfortable. The bar and rooms service are great as well, however I must mention that the morning wait staff are not friendly at all-- except for one young African American (pregnant) lady, she was very attentive &amp; had great customer service. The food was good, especially the brunch. The bartenders in the evening are friendly. Starbucks is a plus to have in the lobby. We stay at this location EVERYTHING is nearby.We will return soon. 
153105408	 This was one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in! The hotel has retained its historic charm while feeling like a brand new hotel (remodeled bathrooms, new bedding, new furnishings, etc). The room was immaculately clean and very comfortable while still feeling luxurious. Despite being on a busy road, the hotel was also fairly quiet and peaceful. It was also just one block from the McPherson Square metro station, so you don't even need to take a cab to get to and from the airport or other destinations across the city. Great stay! 
153080882	 Very nice hotel. Easy walking distance to the Mall and the White house. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. It wasn't the most comfortable bed I slept on and even on the 11th floor there was quite a bit of street noise. Overall though, I'd stay there again. 
157016172	 This was my second trip to this hotel and both times I had a wonderful experience. The rooms were spacious and well appointed. The staff was terrific, from the front desk, valet parking, room service and housekeeping. There is a small fridge and Keurig in each room which was very nice. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was lovely. The location was terrific...within walking distance to the White House and the metro. This is my new favorite place to stay in DC and I cannot wait to return in May for another conference! 
157008621	 I stayed here for two nights with my family for a quick weekend in D.C. I have three kids, so we were able to get two connecting bedrooms. The hotel was able to book these connecting rooms in advance, which was great (might be because I am platinum member). The rooms were also reward nights that I had earned. The hotel is in pretty good location, about 10 minute walk to White House and Pennsylvania avenue. Additionally, if you take the old town trolley tour, the 2nd stop is right in front of the willard hotel, right about at the 10 minute walk time from the Crowne Plaza. The rooms at the hotel are smaller...but they are very modern. Bathrooms are also newer, but small. Beds are real full size (2 per room), NOT queen, so be prepared for smaller beds. Our only issue's at the hotel was that there was no one outside to valet our car when we pulled up, but they were readily available once we came inside. Also, the room service person did not start cleaning our room until around 5pm on Sunday night. That was a bit annoying as we came back from a day of walking the city, wanting to rest before dinner...but had to all cram into one of our rooms while they cleaned the other. It was taking so long, I just had her clean the bathroom of the second room, and told her to leave everything else alone. We needed to get changed to go out to dinner. The second night we ate in the restaurant in the hotel. VERY good food and pleasantly surprised. All of us enjoyed our meals and Caesar, the waiter, was extremely professional and courteous. We felt like we were eating in a much more expensive restaurant. As others have noted, the wifi charge is crazy...Did not need it as I have mifi device that we could share, but without this, I would never stay there with 5 people as they charge $12.95 per device per day. The could be a deal breaker for many. 
156922899	 We stayed here for just one night. The location is perfect to walk to the museums. <br/>On arriving we were told very pleasantly that the check in is at 3pm. They were happy to store the luggage. We went off to the museum of American history came back and were swiftly checked in.<br/>The front desk staff were all very pleasant. <br/>We had breakfast included and the Orange Juice (freshly squeezed) was a big hit with all. Good choice for breakfast.<br/><br/>The room was clean and looked recently done up. <br/>I will also hav a whinge about the internet. In this day and age even the basic hotels offer it free. <br/>Hope Crowne plaza offer it soon and to everybody not just your regular customers. 
156651225	 For starts this is a beautiful historic hotel and and is nicely restored. The room looked recently updated, upscale and in fine taste. Everything worked and was in top shape. The bed was plush and comfortable. The location is excellent and central, good for a first time visitor or for business people. With all that said, there are several down sides. 1. The King room was very small, around 240 sq ft INCLUDING the bathroom and closet. There is a luggage rack in the tiny closet but no room to put it, so you suite cases went on the floor and the single upholstered chair. 2. They charge $12.50 a day for internet PER DEVICE, so if you and your wife each have an i-pad...$25 per day. When I suggested that this is out of line and way out of date, they said that in a few months the frequent users of the hotel chain will get it for free. To add salt to injury, the business center charges by the minute AND the Starbucks outside the front door had no internet because they are owned by the hotel !?!? and the hotel will not allow them to offer it so that they stick their customers with up charges. 3. The atmosphere is stiff and the staff is formal and inflexible. Not much going on at the bar either though it is cute. 4. As it is a business area everything shuts down at 3pm. A more fun place to stay would be Connecticut avenue close to the DuPont Circle where there are lots of restaurants and shops open. 5. The location is a bit noisy, you hear street traffic and honking, also as you sleep so close to the door and there is quite a space underneath the door (I guess to stick in the newspaper and bill) you hear everything said in the hall. All in all considering the high price, I was not impressed. One last comment, my girlfriend had a pair of pants missing on the last night. A very nice (nicest attitude by far) security man came to take the report (we hardly had room to stand). We did not think it was stolen but rather arrived at the conclusion that due to the tight fit of the room, when the sheets were stripped off the bed, the pants which were folded on top of the suitcase on the floor were rolled up with them. The laundry is not done on premises so we did not have high hopes of finding them but upon returning home we were notified that the laundry company did retrieve them. I do appreciate the follow up. 
156528476	 This is the second time we have stayed here. This hotel is perfectly located for either walking or using the Metro to get to all the attractions in DC. We stayed here for 7 nights.<br/>The reception area is beautifully appointed and the Bar and Restaurant are of a high standard.<br/>We had a King room on the 14th floor (1412) it was away from the lifts and with no-one above us a quiet room apart from the traffic noise which i dont think you can get away from in DC.<br/>The room was large and had everything we needed and more. The bedding was changed every day and the room was very clean.<br/>The breakfast buffet was superb, there is a chef on hand who makes your eggs to order in front of you anyway you want. We also had dinner in the restaurant one evening and the waitress Miss Agnes recommended the 'special' which was excellent. I also had lunch in the restaurant and the Crab cake was the tastiest i have had in a long time.<br/>We spent a lot of time in the Bar area the staff were very attentive.<br/>The reception staff were all very helpful. My husband used the carparking facilities where they take the car away and park it and bring it back when you ask. A little pricey but its DC.<br/>Without question this an excellent hotel and would highly recommend it. 
156512194	 The Crowne Plaza is located in a great spot. About 2-3 blocks from White House (great walk). I was there with my 11yr and 9 yr old sons, its safe area and easy walking distance to various sites (national mall area etc). We stayed for 3 nights over Easter weekend. If you have a vehicle, keep in mind the temporary stopping in front of hotel is limited and small. We arrived on a Friday (March 29).. and traffic in front of hotel was busy but manageable. I was able to park in front and unload quickly with the help of conceirge. Once you have your belongings, your vehicle is quickly moved away to a parkade off site (i am not even sure where, i think the next block over). Nevertheless, staff is very efficient and parking was secure but pricey. I paid $43/per night + 7.50 paking tax (just keep that in mind). Hotel, i paid $159 CDN, plus $20 room tax and another misc. tax/ night (i got a great deal but watch the tax add ons) ... so cost can add up quickly. The hotel placed us into a room with King size bed (eventhough) they knew there was 3 of us. There were no cots available. So the first night 3 of us cuddled in one bed (just like camping). The room was excellent, small but nicely laid out, and clean. On the second night, the hotel remedied the sleeping situation by providing a nice cot at no charge. Keep in mind the hotel does not have a pool or hot tub etc. This was not a huge issue for us but it would have been nice to soak in a hot tub after a long day of walking...but not a deal breaker. There is so much to do and see in D.C. that we rarely stayed in hotel anyways. Overall, very happy with my choice of hotel after doing my research and getting the best price i could on Easter long weekend. Staff are friendly and helpful. Restaurant bar is also nice and food is good at reasonable prices. My priority was finding a place that was safe for me and my children and I felt very safe here. 
67456042	 While taking my daughter to visit colleges in DC we booked a room using Priceline. We named our price $200 and were booked at this hotel. When we checked in we asked to extend the stay by another night and were able to negotiate a price for $239. This is a classy hotel in a great location, but I call these hotels the nickel and dime hotels. No free internet, $12.95 for 24 hours. No wi fi lobby even. No breakfast. The Starbucks is fine, unless you like spending $40 for two for breakfast. Since we had driven from Chicago we had to park our car while at the hotel. The parking is $38 per night, includes tax. Fairly normal for parking in the city. The concierge at thehotel was very well informed regarding colleges as he is doing a PhD at Georgetown. He was also helpful regarding restaurants. Try DC Coast across the street and Old Ebbits Grill a few blocks away. When we left the parking valet took 50 minutes to retrieve my car. I had an appointment 3 hours away and lost valuable time waiting for the car. The doorman, Pierre, took his own initiative to call the manager over and she credited my account for the two nights of parking. Mistakes happen, but it is the right thing to do to immediately correct them. I appreciated the way this was handled and will stay there again. The ceiling in the bathroom was patched and peeling and it should have been repaired a bit better, otherwise the room was fine. 
67282963	 Very disappointed, I want clean, spacious rooms for cost of greater than $180 a night. This was purchased through Priceline.com. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The lobby smelled, the furniture was worn, the bathroom was not clean, and the room was barely bigger than a closet. The location was great and nearby several restaurants, and a Metro stop. The staff was very nice to us. But, the acceptable location and staff didn't make up for the cost and the room's lack of cleanliness/size. 
67115038	 We recently went to Washington for a week sight seeing and stayed at the Hamilton. Hotel rooms of a good standard, some items not quite 100% clean cabinet draw fronts with something spilt down them. Items in the bathroom dusty. Otherwise clean and cleaned daily. Main concern cofee percolator in the bathroom. Asked for a new one at reception which was provided and fresh beverages.<br/>Ate evening meal once in the 14K was served so quickly hadnt finished starter before main course had arrived, felt rushed ended up with indigestion and didnt finish main.<br/><br/>Location a few blocks from most things, not many evening restraunts tip eat on your way back probably cheaper. On 10th and E street Hard rock, ESPN. 
67029080	 The rooms are clean comfortable and have a LCD TV. Bathroom very clean. The hotel is beautiful and the area is close to a subway station and you can walk around to see DC. Very good price and the room was worth it!! I would stay again!! 
66995907	 We stayed here over Memorial Day weekend. No complaints. Clean, AC worked and responded to the individual thermostat, flat screen TV, but no personal refrigerator in room. Attractive lobby area with adjacent bar (looked nice, but we did not visit). This hotel is an easy walk to major DC attractions (the White House, the National Mall). The McPherson Square Metro stop (Blue and Orange lines) is just two blocks away. This stop will get you to all of the attractions on the south side of the Mall. On one of the nights, we were awakened to sounds of people partying on the street somewhere (even though we were on the ninth floor). Overall, any inconveniences were minor and did not really distract from the enjoyment of our stay. 
66780978	 I would definitely stay at the Hamilton Crown Plaza again. The location was great, one block from the Metro. We were upgraded and given free continental breakfast each morning, which was very plentyful. The room was a little on the small side, but very comfortable. The only down side is the shortage of restaurants within walking distance but the metro being close made it easy to get around. The decor was tasteful and the hotel overall had plenty of old character. I'd give it an 8.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. 
7225797	 It was spring break time so went to D.C. with daughter and college freshman grandson, a first visit for him. Crowne Plaza Hamilton is a welcome refuge in the heart of downtown. And not overly filled with loud kids. We had 2 rooms on the 5th floor with some street noise but not bad. Decor is subdued and tasteful, soft browns and golds, both in rooms and public areas. Beds, night stand, 2 chairs and desk filled room. Sheets a bit scratchy but rooms well maintained. Too bad there was no fridge. Bathroom fine for 1 but cramped for 2 but plenty of fresh soft white towels. No bath/shower gel only soap.<br/>Hotel restaurant, 14K, had lovely large windows with views of the park and the passing scene. Tables were well spaced permitting quiet conversations. Food surprisingly good, not too imaginative but interesting choices. Liked sirloin tip risotto.<br/>Apart from a surly omelet maker ,a surly front desk attendant and a mostly absent concierge the rest of the hotel staff: from housekeeping to wait staff to porters and doormen were exemplars of southern charm and courtesy and seemed to sincerely like their work.<br/>Location:Not too many places to dine in the area but right across the street from the Segway concession. The kids thought the Segway tour an awesome way to see the capitol.<br/>At a rack rate of $359 you may find the Hamilton overpriced, but if you can get a deal you will be just fine.<br/> 
7191804	 We stayed at the Crowne Plaza (formerly the Hamilton) the weekend of March 17th. I have stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Silver Spring, so I had pretty high expectations. When we pulled up to the valet parking area, there was a tax and an SUV there so we pulled into the alley next to the Starbucks. I am a priority card member of the Crowne Plaza (free to sign up , but you save money on valet parking). The staff was quick to help and immediately helped park the car (we carried our own bags, but they did offer to get them for us). The initial room (922) was a little small, smelled like wet dog, and when I turned on the bedside light, the bulb blew up! I went down to the lobby and explained what had happened. They changed my room to 911 (larger and no funky smell) without hesitation. The wireless internet costs $9.95 per day. The bar and restaurant had excellent staff who constantly checked on us. The breakfast buffet was amazing. The bar was friendly. Overall, a very enjoyable stay and I would absolutely recommend this for others. I had no problems with heat/fan/cool or water temperatures. The elevators were small, but there are a bank of them and they are fast. They don't stop at each floor like some other reviewers have reported, I guess they fixed the problems. The hotel is quite centric to all of the sites you’d want to see and kid friendly. Have a Starbucks on the premises is a plus in my book!<br/> 
6891754	 Will concur with AtlJ123 review - I think we were at the same meeting - as the hotel was very convenient and clean, but had some problems. The hot water was scalding in the sink but lukewarm at best from the showers in the am; the elevators were very frustrating, and I could easily hear the TV from the room next door. However, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the room very clean; my sister was simultaneously at a conference about 6 blocks away, and preferred my hotel. The food at the in-hotel restaurant was excellent and reasonably priced, and the wait staff recognized me after my first meal and gave me excellent and personal service. One of the best things about this hotel is the restaurant across the street - don't miss DC Coast!<br/> 
6796385	 Stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in late January for 2 nights. The shower was cold both mornings. Sound proofing between rooms was not good. Front desk service was slow.<br/> 
6720546	 I stayed here late January for a DC meeting. Our meeting size was about 100 attendees. Many of them had issues with the heater not working and no hot water in the morning. I discussed this with several of the staff, but I am not sure the message made it to the right people (and I know I wasn't the only one who expressed my concerns). There was also at least one elevator that would stop on every floor all the way up and all the way down (even if the button was not pushed). The hotel is nice, clean, and comfy--but with edgy staff and no hot water, it was a frustrating stay. I am not sure I would choose to stay here again.<br/> 
6720420	 I go to DC several times a year, and usually stay at the Hamilton. Why? It's a block from the Metro, which is nice if you fly into Washington National, or take the Flyer from Dulles. The rooms are clean and quiet. The staff is friendly and helpful. The price is right, given that DC is an expensive city to stay in; the Hamilton is perhaps the best value in town. All in all, I've had a great stay every time. <br/><br/>The only thing you need to watch out for is the cancellation policy. If you book through the hotel web site, any cancellation, no matter how far in advance, ends up costing you a night's room rental. (Perhaps this is not a policy for 100% of the rooms 100% of the time, but whenever I travel it ends up applying to me.) At least if you call and cajole enough you can generally get them to change the date of your stay without charging you. This factor bumps the Hamilton down a star for me, because I travel to DC solely for business, and business travel is subject to change more than personal travel.<br/> 
3650631	 Just got back from one night's stay at the Hamilton. It is more than a 3-star, but less than a 4-star and I have no reservations in recommending it. It is a carefully restored classic hotel from the early 20th Century with a marvelously ornate lobby. It is located just a few blocks from the White House, not much farther than some of the most famous DC hotels like the Hay Adams and the St. Regis.<br/><br/>Consistent with its age, there is not a large check-in area. Consequently, when it gets busy, it may take a little while to check in or out. After waiting a slightly long spell, I was given an upgrade to the &quot;executive floor (14th) for my patience even though I had booked the room through a cut-rate internet service.<br/><br/>The room, while on the dinky side (remember old hotels do not have uniformly-sized rooms) was extremely well-appointed and had an impressive array of amenities. The bedding was first rate. Budget buyers beware, you would not want to be in the smaller rooms with more than 2 people, and those two had best be more than just friends.<br/><br/>There is a very nice (better than most 4-star hotels) exercise room on the second floor with a broad assortment of cardio machines, free weights, and not a few weight training machines.<br/><br/>The lobby bar/restaurant also exceeded expectations. I had appetizers and cocktails at the bar. Food and service were fine. Although I did not eat at the buffet the next morning, I circled it. The food appeared to be on a par with a more expensive hotel, yet the price was quite reasonable by comparison at $10.95 per person.<br/><br/>On the whole, I was pleasantly surprised by nearly everything about this hotel and would happily return. 
3544799	 Read many reviews on TripAdvisor.com before we booked our trip. I decided this hotel would be best for us. The hotel was great! Excellent staff, very nice! We did have a &quot;round-up&quot; of prostitutes around 5:30 AM on our first night at the hotel. We were on the 2nd floor on the front of the hotel, so I was ready for loud noises, sirens, etc.; however, nothing prepared me or my 8-year old Granddaughter for the sting operation. As the &quot;8 ladies&quot; were being loaded into the police vehicle, my granddaughter looked out the window and said, &quot;They're taking them to jail. But why are they so dressed up?&quot;<br/> 
3533200	 I just returned from a one night stay at the Crowne Plaza. For location and price ($100.00) you can't beat it. Everything you would want to see (White House, all the memorials, the Smithsonian museums) is within walking distance. The hotel itself is very clean, the staff very helpful and the beds extremely comfortable. The $28 parking fee is a bit over the top, but unless you can find one of the metered spaces on the street, my advise is to just park the car and leave it there. Anything not within walking distance(like RFK stadium) is easily accessible by the Metro, which is only a block away from the hotel. And avoid the hotel restaurant. The food was good, but again overpriced in my opinion.<br/> 
3494229	 This hotel is a jewel. The service was impeccable from start to finish. Concierge helped with restaurant reservations &amp; checked with us afterwards to ensure our satisfaction. He also allowed us to check in for our flights the next day online &amp; print boarding passes. The beds in this hotel are the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel. They also provide a Sleep Advantage welcome package, which includes a sleep CD, eyemask, earplugs, and aromatherapy spray. My room was small, but this doesn't matter in DC where you're out most of the day. For the AAA rate of $169 a night (least expensive I could find in that area), the value was unbelievable. Would recommend anyone stay there when visiting Washington DC. Excellent!<br/> 
3434194	 I stayed here for 5 nights and it was a business trip.Overall, the hotel is a nice place to stay although not every staff was friendly.After travelling almost 24 hrs to get to Washington, I was expecting to be greeted by some friendly staff. Unfortunately that didn't happen. The registration staff didn't smile at all, the manner was brisk and very formal.You basically didn't feel appreciated.The next day, the lady at the concierge desk was no different.I had a few enquiries as it was my first visit to Washington and by the third question, she didn't even look up to answer my question.I thought that was rude, so I decided not to waste any more of her precious time and quit asking.In fact, I found out later that I had left my scarf on one of the chairs but upon my return to the hotel, I could see it was the same lady there and decided to lose it rather than see her face again.And there was one day that I took a short nap in the afternoon and had the door latched.The housekeeping personnel had opened the door and despite seeing me asleep in bed, shouted through the gap if I had wanted her service. That woke me up of course and gave me a fright, so I just shouted back &quot; no, thanks!!&quot;. Apart from these 3 unfortunate experiences , the rest of the staff was as how they should be. Smiling and friendly.Upon my return to KL, I found out there had been errors on my credit card charges, fault of the credit card company not hotel, and the hotel's accounts personnel was very helpful.Faxing to me immediately copies of statement to my number and the credit card company's number. The room to me was not spacious, but the bed's lovely.I slept well throughout my stay and the sirens weren't that bad.They sounded very distant and was over within seconds.However, I can't imagine staying here again because to me, everything was just average and besides, there are plenty of other hotels to choose from, so why not check out the other hotels.<br/> 
3433673	 stayed during easter break when i received a last minute special from hot-wire...too good to refuse deal for a 4 star hotel....check-in was early and immediate with no problems at all...bellhops were the nicest and i wrote hotel telling them about how friendly and helpful they were..As far as concierge goes..forget about her..very unhelpful and seemed like i was bothering her for asking dinner questions.. did better with the bellhops who recommended places to eat.. first room was small so we had room changed with no problems..seems the weekends are slow time since i found out this is a business hotel so much towards my advantage....next room had view of park and king bed which i would have loved to spend the day in!!! other reviews are right on target with how comfy beds are...overall was a great experience and will definately come back, with one exception is the parking rates..wowo what a ripoff!!! $27. a night is unreasonable and just plain greedy...that alone brought up my bargain to a regular price of other hotels...but what can you do in this day and age of greed....next time will take amtrak there!!!! 
188846344	 The pictures sold me on the hotel and the low price was the closer. Sad to say I got what I paid for. The rooms are nicely decorated they are modern and newly updated. There is a Starbucks on site which is convenient. However, my room didn't have a closet or a place to hang clothes anywhere. The room faced a wall and the location is not great as I would have preferred it to be closer to Pennsylvania Avenue. The walls are paper thin and they provide ear plugs along with their sewing kits...that was odd. However, all of that was tolerable until...our toilet backed up and stayed that way all day long. It didn't flush in the morning and we didn't have time to call when we were getting ready. We forgot on our way out to tell the front desk and then figured housekeeping would advise when they came to clean the room. Well Housekeeping obviously doesn't clean toilets here. When we left at 8:00 and returned at 10:30 pm our bathroom smelled horrible as the toilet was still backed up. I called the front desk and told them I didn't understand how the person cleaning the room didn't report this problem. They had nothing to say and didn't apologize for the oversight. Just said they would send someone up. The fact our bathroom didn't really get cleaned was disgusting to say the least. Our fault for not reporting but their fault for not opening a toilet to clean it. Will not be staying again. What else do they not clean here!!!! 
188632684	 I have stayed here several times on business, most recently in early December. Located at 14th and K and across the street from DC Coast, a favorite DC restaurant, the hotel is just a few blocks from many downtown office locations. You can easily walk to the MacPherson Square metro station and from there get anywhere in DC. The lobby is small but well appointed and comfy and there's a Starbucks just down the hall from the reception desk. I booked online for my last visit and reserved a park view room facing 14th street. Do not do this. The park in question is Franklin Square, which is inhabited by loud, rowdy homeless people and squawking police cars at night. After two nights of no sleep, I asked to be moved. My next room, though smaller, was on the tenth floor on the other side of the hotel and was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. The rates were good for DC and I would definitely stay in one of the quieter rooms here again. 
188248146	 This is a nice hotel. I had a couple problems at check in, but the manager Joseph and guest relations took care of it right away. I was very impressed. Also the restaurant in the hotel was nice as well. The food was excellent and the servers Cori &amp; Gino were simply amazing. We were in town for a friends 21st birthday. This hotel suited us very well. Would recommend to anyone! 
188153231	 Location: <br/><br/>Great location in the heart of DC. You can walk to the White House and other monuments/attractions and is two blocks from the metro. Lots of restaurants and lounges around to have fun. <br/><br/>Service:<br/>The hotel staff is absolutely the most pleasant and helpful staff I have ever came across. We had a conference and the staff went above and beyond their duties to ensure our guests were satisfied and our event was a success. <br/><br/>Amenities: <br/>Standard comfortable beds in a standard size room. 3 of us stayed in a room with two double beds and were comfortable. I was knocked out as soon as I hit the bed. The rooms and bathroom were clean. Although, my view wasn't the best view, I had other friends that stayed in rooms with a great view of the city. As a coffee drinker it was a delight to have a Starbucks in the lobby. The food at the hotel restaurant is delicious. I had the wings which were fantastic!!!!! The burger was even more delicious. <br/><br/>Other: <br/>You would not need a car staying at this hotel as the bus stop is only a few steps from the hotel and taxi's are readily available at your service. In addition, the metro is literally one block away.If you do decide to drive, the hotel has overnight parking and there are cheaper parking garages within walking distance of the hotel. <br/><br/>Overall: <br/>I had a great stay and the would recommend this hotel to everyone. 
188079305	 My wife and I came in last Friday and check out on Monday. During the three nights we were there they were greeted us professionally and pleasantly every time we came and left the hotel. The restaurant inside the hotel, 14k, provided decent food and was a great convenience, especially with the free appetizer and free non alcoholic drinks we received for our IHG Rewards membership each night between 5-9pm. The room was nicer than expected, especially for the price. If we ever come visit DC again we will definitely stay here. 
188073898	 I stayed at the Hamilton for three nights recently. When I entered the room I was very impressed, because I was facing a floor to ceiling, wall to wall window with a view of the D.C. skyline and the Washington Monument. What really made it nice was that the beds were placed against the opposite wall so that while sitting up in bed, morning and evening, you can enjoy the spectacular view. The decor was very classy as well, a sedate gray and neutral tone predominates. There was a coffee maker and small fridge, very convenient. I did stay on the Executive Level, as the rooms were a bit bigger, so I am not sure if all rooms are as nicely laid out as the one I had. The Executive Level also includes a free continental breakfast on weekdays.<br/> The hotel lobby has beautiful architectural details, and a Starbucks just around the corner from the front desk was a plus. The 14k restaurant and bar were both really nice. I heard from a friend of mine who lives in D.C. that the bar is a favorite meeting place for local government workers, and I can see why: nicely laid out, big, comfortable bar chairs. I ate at the restaurant one night and had a very good meal, no complaints. Be aware of the fee structure for the room. The price varies greatly from night to night, weekends being less expensive that weeknights. When I made my reservation through the hotel website, the price quoted was $179 per night, which is a very good rate for a nice hotel in this city. But the actual bill showed the first night as $129, the next as $169 and the last night as $274 per night, so they are averaging the cost of the stay obviously, when they quote you a price. My roommate got stuck in D.C. with a cancelled flight due to bad weather and she ended up booking an extra night at the exorbitant rate of $374 for that night. Also worth noting is that the WiFi costs $12 per day, and there is a charge of 50 cents per minute if you wish to use the computers in the hotel's business center.<br/> To summarize: this is a great downtown D.C. hotel in a fantastic location! You can walk to the White House, the Smithsonian and the Convention Center. The Metro stop is nearby. I would recommend this hotel for business travel and for anyone seeking a central location while seeing the sights in D.C. You are right in the middle of everything, but the downside is that you are likely to hear sirens on 14th and K St. night and day. I loved the beds, very comfortable and conducive to sleep when the street noise is not too loud. 
164607714	 We had a wonderful week in this hotel. They gave us a room upgrade which was a lovely surprise. The staff in restaurant, front desk, concierge, chamber maids were always helpful and very friendly. The room was stylish, and clean and the bed was heaven. We could have wished for cheaper Wi-fi but there was a Starbucks 5 minutes walk away where it was free. <br/>From the hotel all the sites are within walking distance and if that is not an option, the metro is very close and the doorman can always find a cab. I would certainly recommend this hotel for a stay in DC. 
164425626	 Really good remodel of this classic hotel. From the the doorman to the cleaning ladies the staff is solid. Bartenders were good and not intrusive, just efficient and friendly.<br/><br/>Rooms are small but well appointed. Comfy bed. I found the small room only a problem if more than 1-2 persons would be in them, Junior suite is the way to go if this is the case. I tried standard room and Jr suite when my family came to meet me for 2 nights.<br/><br/>Hotel location is OK, good for business in the area but a bit of a walk for the kids to the Mall to see museums. <br/><br/>Bang for the buck, this property is great. 
164330857	 We stayed in a nice renovated room. The staff was great and helpful. The hotel is about a 30 minute walk from Union station. DC blocks are not your average neighborhood blocks. There are a few eateries nearby. The elevators are very small, I guess thats why they have 5 of them. The room was small but clean. 
164286868	 Stayed here for three days, two nights in June 2013 with a friend. The room and the hotel itself were lovely. The beds were the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on in a hotel room!! Nice location - walking distance from lots of the touristy sights. Great restaurants and such right nearby too. It's in a busy area where I felt safe. Every one of the hotel staff members who we encountered were helpful and friendly. It was a wonderful weekend! 
164274387	 We loved this hotel...not huge but not small..perfect size with charm and history in great location. Staff were helpful and very friendly. Room had charm and nice details with comfy bed and pillows. Room was small but well done and perfectly cozy for my husband and me. We were on 8th floor with lovely view of park and Washington monument.<br/><br/>One warning and reason I did not give 5 stars... Lower floor rooms are noisy. We were originally assigned a room 2nd floor but asked desk gentleman for higher floor...which they kindly accommodated. We were thrilled with our stay but probably would not have been as happy on lower floor. 
164041668	 My Best Friend and I needed a good girls night hotel. This was definitely it. It's really beautiful and in the business district area. <br/><br/>Two great things- bar and Starbucks next to lobby. Ros are updated as stylish.<br/><br/>A few things worth noting- they have nice in house emenities -vanity kit, k-cups, oils for the pillows, &amp; firm beds.<br/><br/>The location and noise are the only negative. Our room was front of the building and low floor. That sucks. There are two popular bars near by with constant police activity making noise through the night.<br/><br/>Size of rooms are small. They are a little cramped if its more than two people even though its double beds.<br/><br/>Overall I definitely would stay here again. 
49712670	 Rate: $249 night during the week (Corporate rate). Competitor rates were in the $400-$500 per night range.<br/><br/>Liked: Location - distance from airport was great (cab ride was $15 from DCA). Restaurants within walking distance. Room was adequate but definitely dinky. Liked the small amenity bag with linen spray, ear plugs and a sleep mask that was left on the bed. Nice touch. Starbucks within the hotel and was a definite hot spot in the morning for both walking patrons from the street and hotel guests. Gal at the check in desk was friendly and accomodating as she allowed me to check in early (1:30 PM) AND gave me a nice-ish room with a view that overlooked a park and a distant view of the Washington Monument. The room, while small, was comfortable. Bed was nice. Air conditioner/heating unit was a bit loud when it kicked on (it woke me up once during the night - not a biggie) and somewhat temperamental, but worked well enough for one night. <br/><br/>Had a cocktail at the hotel bar, called 14K, and the bartender, Meriam, was delightful and was quick to recommend places for us to venture out to during the evening if we didn't want to stay at the hotel. She was a gem and nice to have wait on us!<br/><br/>Disliked/Needs improvement: Room size was dinky, but really, that's about it.<br/><br/>Hotel was a bit dated but not enough for me to complain or write poorly about it. I would definitely stay there again for business or pleasure. 
49482015	 The hotel is old, but nice--fully renovated. Service was excellent. Rooms quite small, even in a suite, but quite accommodating. Had to put coffee on table. There just wasn't any room for it anywhere else. Concierge was great. Front desk staff great. We chose to eat several meals at the hotel since we were there for 5 nights. Food was very good with a great selection on the menu. It rained most of the time we were there and the concierge loaned us an umbrella and also told us there was one in our closet as well. There was! For a downtown D.C. hotel, where lots of walking is required, the umbrella was quite convenient. Enjoyed our stay. Rooms a bit pricey and meals a bit pricey, but it was that where everywhere in D.C. I would stay there again. 
48325339	 We travelled with two younger teenage girls so decided to share a two-double room. The room was on the third floor and was spacious enough - the beds were comfortable though the room was quite noisy as it faced directly onto K street with its associated heavy traffic.<br/><br/>The location was excellent with the white house and national mall each being about 10 minutes walk away. There are a number of cafes and restaurants nearby for breakfast etc and there is a starbucks outlet in the hotel itself. Be careful as a number of the cafes close at a weekend - this is quite a business area.<br/><br/>The staff were friendly and the hotel is medium sized so it never feels too busy. We had a drink in the nice, busy and quite reasonably priced bar/restaurant but otherwise ate out. We especially enjoyed the Gordon Biersch bar-restaurant which is approx 15 minutes walk from the hotel.<br/><br/>Whilst I didnt feel that the hotel was right to brand itself &quot;boutique&quot;, it was overall a positive experience. 
48272432	 Very welcoming, Executive room very comfortable and clean, large room had been recently decorated. Locked floor for women travellers. Comfortable bed and armchairs. Excellent location for white house and metro. Restaurant good choice of food and excellent service. Some of the reception staff arrogrant and very officious could do with a smile. 
47427058	 We spent four nights at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza Hotel and found it to be just perfect for our needs. It was an older, but well kept hotel, very clean, comfortable and in a great ,downtown location. We were fortunate to get a room on a higher floor and away from the street so we did not experience any noise whatsoever. Housekeeping did an outstanding job each day. All types of transportation (Metro, City buses and the Circulator bus) were all within a block of the hotel. The lounge and restaurant were great. The food was exceptionally good for a hotel restaurant and the prices were typical Wash DC nice restaurant prices. All in all we were very pleased and would highly recommend this hotel. 
47016969	 Awful service, tired, old hotel, not clean, not very firendly. Oher than a superb location, it has nothing to offer.<br/>Hated very minute of it -stayed 4 days. 
139742547	 As will all of my reviews I like to start with the good aspects of a property and then provide the less than good portions of my review. Outside of being in the Caribbean, this property has the most friendly staff I have ever encountered in the U.S. Considering this is an East Coast property, that makes it ever more shocking. The workout room is really nice. Way above the usual Crown standards. They had 3 stepper/glide machines, 3 treadmills, 3 stationary bikes, dumb bells that went up to 50's, and 2 separate machines for the legs. The 14K bar is really nice and they have amazing deals for their happy hour (5 - 7 pm EST). Jose is the main bartender during the week and he is soooo friendly. A really nice guy that can pour a good drink. I strongly recommend the fish taco happy hour meal. The breakfast buffet was very nice as well. I really appreciated the omelet to order. They also had french toast, pancakes, fresh bacon and sausage to select from. An overall good breakfast experience. <br/>The other part of this property that was enjoyable is the White House and Department of Treasury buildings are easily walkable. There is also a METRO site within 2 blocks for the blue and orange lines. I found this to be especially helpful as the blue line is what runs out of Regan International airport. <br/>The downside of this property is that it was under construction while I was there. Now none of the 'dust' bothered me and it appeared as if they were done with the heavy stuff and were working on more of the decoration stuff. The bummer for me was the concierge level was completed but not up and running. I wasn't able to have the full concierge experience. That being said, it looked very nice and when it is operable I assume it will be at the usual Crown standards for that level of room.<br/>The only down side is this is the East Coast and their idea of a 'spacious' room is far different than the rest of the U.S. I was upgraded to the King suite level super-dee-duper room and it was nice sized but not overwhelming by any means. The TV was large and had a great picture. I could see the Washington Monument from my room, so that was cool. <br/>The only real 'problem' I had with the room was the phone. It was horrible. I let the front office know about it but I guess there was no fix for it. I think once the renovations are complete there will be a nicer phone but as it is now the phone stinks. The phone in the complementary business room downstairs was horrible as well. If you need to make calls, plan on using a cell phone not the room phone or the business center's phone.<br/>The one point I think this property should advertise a bit more is there is a $15 per day fee if you want to access the Wi-Fi. You either pay the $15 or pay per minute, but the per minute fee is so high you might as well pay the $15. <br/>When my business travels will bring me back to WDC and I do plan to stay here again. 
139388533	 The staff was proactive in making sure our stay was good and seemed to truly want us to enjoy not only the stay at the hotel but also DC. There were a couple of minor issues, and their response to fix it (even when it was the tour company's issue - not the hotel's) was commendable. The hotel was comfortable even in the rennovation stages. 
139124026	 I recently stayed at Hamilton Crowne Plaza and I have to say overall not bad....Staff was very nice and actually seemed happy about helping you out with anything you might need. Being that the hotel is under going renovations you may need helping finding some things such as vending, ice, front desk (smile). I was a little skeptical before checkin about some of the reviews and pictures online of the rooms but I got to stay in one of the renovated rooms im assuming and the decor was great although the bed could have been a little more comfortable a lil stiff. Mini fridge and/or microwave wouldve been nice. Location was convenient for pretty much everything metro was pretty much a block or two away. Wireless at 12.95 per device was a lil much but it worked. I think i would definitely come back and stay when renovations are all complete..... 
138812334	 I was in DC for 7 days last week. 3 days on my dime at the Hilton Garden Inn and 5 days on the company dime while I attended training.<br/><br/>My opinion is that the Hilton provided twice the value at half the cost per night. The rooms at the Crowne were tiny and outdated, did not include a microwave or minifridge, and they charge $12 per device, per day for a fairly low quality wireless internet connection. The bed was also somewhat uncomfortable to sleep on.<br/><br/>Other thoughts are that the food was mediocre in the restaurant and the drinks at the bar were overpriced and weak.<br/><br/>I do have to say though that the hotel location is very convenient and that the staff wer outstanding. Not only were they were polite and helpful when I checked in early on Monday, they also offered suggestions when I had an early flight out on Saturday morning. <br/><br/>If it had been me paying for the trip rather than my company, I would have spent the entire 7 days at the hilton with the bigger room, the amazingly comfortable bed, the microwave, the minifridge, and the free faster internet access...all for less than half the price per night of the Crowne. 
138457923	 We stayed at the hotel Aug 16th for two nights. The staff were extremely helpful when our pre booked reservation did not show up in there system. Michelle the front line worker was especially helpful as we had just drove nine hours from Toronto and just wanted to go to our room. Our rate was honoured and we began to enjoy our vacation.<br/><br/>The hotel was under construction so it was hard to find the vending machines as they were out of service. Good restaurant for breakfast, room was really small but newly renovated you could still smell the glue from the new carpet in the hallway. I would recomend this hotel. But I will never book anything on red tag again. They outsource to a company called travel now and they are very unreliable. 
138152118	 The renovated rooms, done with pure class, updated but done with care for the historical value of this structure, are just fabulous. Details like a Keurig coffeemaker and fabulous bathrobes make the rooms pure heaven! The lobby is very comfortable and welcoming, and I was greeted with a complimentary glass of wine. Although the hotel's renovations make this a first-class beauty, the real value of this location is the wonderful staff. I interacted with at least a dozen employees, and every single one of them were very responsive and completely helpful as we tried to make the most of our time in the city. The crepe restaurant across the street was wonderful - go for brunch and be hungry! The location of the hotel could not be more convenient. One block to metro which is direct to Reagan airport. I cannot recommend this hotel enough - it will be too long until I get back there. My new favorite! 
90297071	 My boyfriend brought me to DC for my birthday. He booked us 2 nights at the Hamilton. The location is the best thing about this hotel. The hallway had a 'funk' outside our room. I thought maybe it was a dryer from doing laundry? Inside our room was perfectly fine. No smell, it was clean and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. But everytime we stepped in the hall, we were like 'what is that smell??' Another thing that annoyed me, but I'm not sure this isn't everywhere, parking was $36 a night. How I said, I don't know most or all other places don't have such high prices for parking, I just thought $70 in 2 days was a lot to park our car. They only have valet, so you don't even have the option not to have to pay that. We did eat at 14K, the restaurant in the hotel, and the food was decent. I didn't like the au gratin potatoes that came with the steak, but thats just my opinion. But we paid $105 for calamari, french onion soup, 2 beers, 1 glass of house wine and 2 steak dinners. I guess for around DC that's the average price per dinner plate (we were searching for about an hour looking at reviews of restaurants, and most said $30 a plate) But I just think I could have been more satisfied for $105. Overall, the dinner was ok though. If I could recommend a restaurant I would recomment the Old Ebbitt, we were referred there but when we called at 6pm the first reservation they had was 10pm, so needless to say, we didn't go there. I saw all raving reviews of that restaurant though, only negative comments were that it was loud/crowded. But for a better, more reasonably priced meal, I think it'd be worth it. Anyway- Overall our DC trip was a lot of fun, I just would do more research on the parking issue next time. 
89923637	 The exterior and public areas are very pretty, but they belie what's inside. As another reviewer reported, of four elevators, two worked, and they were small capacity. They would stop on every floor but they were already jam packed. The smell of sewage was apparent when one of the elevators reached the lobby. Whenever I needed to speak to someone at the front desk, they were always engaged in conversation with each other which did not stop immediately when a guest was waiting. I had to extend my stay by one night; initially they were sold out, but when a room did become available, the rate escalated to $359 a night, a complete rip off for what is basically a gussied up Holiday Inn. If the whole neighborhood hadn't been sold out, I would have moved to another property. Never again will I stay here. 
89855396	 The staff - particularly the car hop with wonderful attitude and snappy demeanor - were all very very nice. I don't want to malign them. Quite pleasant, polite and of course, the car hop. However, they charge for internet (me no like - not obvious in ad) and the noise was unbearable above me - people in hard pumps. Also, they put me next to an elevator and also next to business offices. So all in all, not too quiet. The food for breakfast was not included but quite good food (although astronomically overpriced).<br/><br/>So, for location, it's fine - but they could do with paring down some of these issues. 
89689854	 if you like 'banana beds', small rooms, cold rooms, leaky drains, really slow elevators, rooms in disrepair, then stay here, if not , go elsewhere. The room service is really really expensive. the restaurant on the main level serves very decent food and the bar has a great happy hour. its proximity to the metro and downtown cant be beat but im sure you could find another place that is much cleaner with better service. 
89375782	 Pretty from the outside, and nice lobby/restaurant, but I will not be staying here again. Traveled to DC for a conference, and unfortunately my company booked this place. The location was great because the conference center was only a block away, but I would've walked a mile if I had a better hotel. Beds are small, ink stained sheets, and outdated bedskirts and drapes. Bathroom was ok, but could've been better. Every morning my shower was COLD. Other people from the conference who are staying here at similar stories. They only have 4 elevators that hold 8 people, but only 2 worked the whole time I was here. The floor that I stayed on smelled stale and kind of like mold. My phone didn't work so I couldn't call the front desk to complain. People at front desk were ok, but hardly any spoke english and seemed more concerned to finishing up their conversations with other employees before helping you. Seems awfully expensive to have so many compliants. There are MUCH better hotels in DC, so if you are booking a vacation, do not stay here. 
89298847	 This hotel has much to recommend it: <br/> decent location - walking distance to many major sites and restaurants<br/> Attractive setting - small but nice lobby, bar and restaurant just off lobby<br/> Helpful staff- we were able to get an upgrade from double beds to suite!<br/> Terrific value even in off season on a weekend - we paid $109 + tax + $33/day parking<br/> (The parking fee was annoying but the separate parking service ultimately cut it in half)<br/><br/>One additional note of importance- the 14K restaurant in the lobby was very nice for breakfast ONLY!!! (and bar is fine but S L O W for drinks) however, the food at the dinner restaurant was just plain awful- uninspired, very overpriced and poorly prepared- skip that one for a plethora of other excellent choices! 
198852275	 Arrived in DC after driving up from North Carolina, and the Hamilton was the best medicine for our tired souls...<br/>Classy and stylish, the room was very well appointed and quite roomy...<br/>We were greeted with a friendly and professional check-in, and our entire stay was hassle free and very enjoyable...<br/>We loved DC and Hotel was the best base we could have had for our visit... Very central, knowledgeable staff, and a great bar/restaurant on site... We had several enjoyable evenings right inside the hotel, as well as good advice about local eateries and bars... 
198733925	 We had a three-night stay here in Feb.2014 and it was a really nice experience.The room is big enough for us with TWO twin-size beds.It offered free coffee and tea in the mini bar inside the room(the coffee machine is also convenient for people like me who need warm water every morning.)Wifi is FREE both inside the room and public area in the hotel, although it was said it would be charged when I booking it. Friendly staff, 3min walks to the subway station, a post office opposite, a 24hr supermarket(CVS) nearby...etc. Definitely will choose here when I come back again in DC. 
198400572	 Good location for all purposes - business and pleasure. Friendly and helpful staff. Good lobby to sit and greet. Very nice bar. Breakfast was good (scrambled eggs a bit gluey). Room and bathroom good. A good stay at a good hotel. 
198247350	 If you are attending events at the Walter E Washington Convention Center, I would recommend The Hamilton Crowne Plaza, as it is about a 10 minute walk to the site. In addition, the hotel is conveniently-located a mere block from the McPherson Metro line, making the airport commute from Reagan National (DCA) an easy trek. For the budget-conscious, t is conveniently located near a CVS, a Dunkin Donuts, and a Five Guys, as well as The Franklin Square Park, which features an array of food trucks daily.<br/><br/>The hotel rooms are recently renovated; and, exceptionally well-appointed. I failed to take a photo; but, wish I had, as words cannot capture the opulence of the room in which I was comfortably ensconced. I was lucky to have a corner room, so noise was no issue, despite the hotel being completely booked.<br/><br/>The travel company that arranged for our corporate housing, had the reservations all mixed up; but, check-in was quick and efficient; and, the name-change was made with aplomb. The young man assisting with check-in mentioned that he was a recent graduate of the UCF Rosen School of Hospitality, which gave us Orlando in common. He asked if I had stayed at the hotel before; and, welcomed me back, when I mentioned I had nearly 20 years prior.<br/><br/>I do have Priority Club Rewards through Holiday Inn, which is a sister-brand of the Crowne Plaza, so ultrahigh-speed Internet was included. And, was probably some of the best service I have received in D.C. The hotel also features an excellent fitness center, which I visited daily. My only two complaints would be the chintzy water service (paper cone-shaped cups); and, no cold towels. Having infused water and plastic cups should be a no-brainer for a hotel of this caliber, as would a small refrigerator, with chilled, damp towels. That would be a level of service, which is reflected in everything else offered by this hotel.<br/><br/>Another guest and I decided to invite one of our executives out to dinner, so the hotel concierge arranged a reservation at The Prime Rib for us, reminding us of the strict dress code. I didn’t have much use for the bell service, bar or restaurant; but, I can say something nice about Starbucks. One morning, I was surprised when a server from Starbucks offered to contact me, when she saw I was waiting for the on-site shoe repair shop to open. Unfortunately, I had appointments with members of Congress, so I didn’t have time to wait for a shoe shine; and, had to settle on taking care of that myself. 
198095683	 I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel and we will definitely be staying here again! It is 1 block north of the McPherson Metro line, about 5 blocks east of the North Farragut Metro line and about a 5-10 min walk to the White House! It is in a nice area right across from the park. It also has a FULL Starbucks attached (yay!), a nice bar, and a surprisingly good restaurant (14K). The hotel rooms were well appointed and nicely decorated. The walls are extremely thin and only one night did it really cause us issues (a bacherlorette party was happening next door and I thought the pictures were going to come off the walls - thankfully they left to 'paint the town pink' by 10 p.m. and then slept until check-out time the next day). We booked early and the price was EXTREMELY good for Spring Break travel and we were very happy there. I will say that the three odd things (which I have to admit - I don't know if it is a DC hotel thing or a Crowne Plaza thing or a 'just-this-hotel' thing) but: <br/><br/>*they don't sell stamps at the front desk -- not a big deal, we found a post office across the street<br/>*they also will not call you a cab -- again, not a big deal, 14th St and K are both very busy streets<br/>*the security people are a lot less personable than the other staff persons -- I accidentally left my jacket in the restaurant and it was turned into lost and found. I was heading out that day so I couldn't go back to get it, but a friend of mine was on her way to pick it up for me. The security person wanted to know if I was 'just a restaurant guest' or if I was a 'hotel guest'??? I don't know why that would matter, but I told him I was both. He also started off with telling me that I better have someone picking it as opposed to them mailing it to me?? I never even suggested for him to mail it! I had a friend coming to pick it up that afternoon. <br/><br/>It was odd and abrupt and did not reflect any of the experiences that I had with the other staff (housekeeping, front desk, concierge, bellman, bar service, restaurant waiter, etc). I was quite surprised! Had I been there in person, I would spoken to the manager, but I was on a train to Baltimore at the moment. So, I would 100% recommend this hotel, but just don't lose anything or else you'll have to talk to the grumpy security man! 
197941536	 My husband and I stayed here for two nights while he was in D.C. on business. This historic hotel is located about two blocks from the McPherson Square Metro station, but if you're there during nice weather and plan to visit the Smithsonian or the monuments, it's only about a 15- to 20-minute walk to the National Mall, and you get to see some cool architecture along the way.<br/><br/>Our standard king room was fairly spacious for a city hotel and very nicely decorated in hues of brown, tan, and rust. It had an Old World masculine vibe to it, with a faint cologne-like scent upon first entering it. Not obnoxious or anything, but definitely there. We were put on the 2nd floor, directly by some scaffolding that had been erected outside because of power washing and repairs – a note left in the room stated that &quot;contractors may be staged outside your room&quot; between 9 and 5. We didn't have that issue, probably because the recent snowstorm put a temporary halt to any such work, but if that's a concern, I'd ask for a higher floor. Also, this hotel is near a fire station, so a higher floor would also help to mute the street noise and sirens associated with that. Other than that, soundproofing between rooms is very good, and there was surprisingly little noise from the restaurant directly below us. In-room amenities include a safe (big enough for a small laptop), a refrigerator, and a Keurig coffee maker with a few K-cups. The flat-screen TV is huge, but the channel selections are geared mostly toward the business clientele that this hotel obviously caters to (i.e., plenty of news and financial stations), and certain stations (like the CW) were inexplicably not in HD. <br/><br/>The biggest complaint I have with our room is how cold it was. The windows weren't at all energy-efficient – cold air was constantly seeping into the room, and pulling down the curtains helped only so far to contain that. We had to crank up the thermostat to 80 degrees and still felt chilled. Matters were even worse in the bathroom, which had a window and only weak baseboard heating in a room that had ice-cold floor tiles. This might be nice to have in DC's infamous hot and humid summers, but when it's freezing outside, the last thing you want is for your feet to touch an equally freezing floor. Also, there was no vanity outside the bathroom, and no outlet that could accommodate a hair dryer within easy reach of the main full-length mirror. There were a couple of decorative mirrors on either side of the bed with writing painted on them, and that's what I ended up using in order to get to an acceptable outlet while my husband was taking his shower. Clearly this room was meant for a single traveler only.<br/><br/>The fitness center looks like it's very well equipped, and I almost wished I'd brought my workout clothes. As for food, vending machines are located mostly on odd-numbered floors and had an acceptable variety of snacks and drinks at $1.50 each. There's an attached Starbucks and an attached (and very pricey) restaurant that we didn't use. There are plenty of other dining options in the local area – we had breakfast at the Corner Bakery a block away – but many of these close between 4 and 8 PM, so don't count on a late-night dinner outside of the hotel. <br/><br/>The front desk staff and doormen are extremely friendly and professional, but check-in took a long time because only two people were at the desk and a number of businessmen were checking in with special requests or other issues. They need to add more people during busy times like that. Also, when you ask someone if this is their first time at your hotel, and they say yes, then don't you think you'd assign them a room away from any possible repair/contractor work to make the best initial impression? There are too many other DC hotels to make a mistake like that.<br/><br/>If thinking about a stay at this hotel, join the free IHG Rewards Club prior to making your reservation so you get free Wi-Fi; otherwise it's $12.95/night. Also, if you're driving, don't pay the exorbitant valet parking rates here. Check out washingtondc.bestparking.com for nearby lots that charge a lot less.<br/><br/>Overall, the stay was okay, but due to the cold tiles in the bathrooms and the cold air coming in from the windows (which might be something that they're getting repaired by the aforementioned contractors), I would only stay here again during the warmer months. Granted, we spent most of our time outside the room during the day, but we shouldn't have to feel like we have to run the heat all the time at night! 
74522645	 We stayed here for 3 nights this past weekend (Thurs-Sun)... My son (13), husband and I. I was able to get a terrific rate on priceline which made it much better. The price and the location were the big draws for me. The hotel has charm and has been updated. We had a front corner room on the 7th floor which meant we had 2 windows plus a window in the bathroom. Lots of light but also definite noise from the street. I am a deep sleeper so between that and exhaustion from walking so much, I had no issues sleeping. My husband had a short lived issue on one of the 3 nights. Everything was clean though the rug could be replaced. I am nuts about hotel bathrooms and this one was just fine. The double beds were ok- not the best but fine. Had a problem with the A/C on our 2nd night and a maitainance worker came right up... he ended up replacing a very dirty filter and it worked so much better... Limited closet space and drawer space. Tight quarters but I am used to small rooms from NYC so it didn't phase me. I had no experience with the resturant in the hotel. My recommendation for this hotel is based on location. We walked everywhere and used the metro several times also. 
74292535	 I stayed here for two nights after a wonderful stay at the immaculate Renaissance Harbourplace in Baltimore. I chose this hotel because 1) it seems to be the most reasonably priced in downtown DC, 2) its close to a metro station, 3) its not far from where I had my meetings, 4) it has in-room safe, and 5) its a Crowne Plaza. Unlike other chains hotels in downtown, its a &quot;historic&quot; rather than a modern hotel. But it has been refurbished to a good standard. The location is OK, but like many downtown area in US cities, its not a particularly exciting place. The restaurant is reasonable. The problem with the hotel, is the staff, maintenance and the upkeep. Here are a few:<br/>1) I am a Platium level Priority Club member, and I believe I get complimentary upgrade, although I have never experienced this yet. So on check in, I asked if I am to get an upgrade. And she said yes and told me she'll give me a room with a good view over the square. Hardly an upgrade but good view. OK. Then, the next day I asked the counter, and the staff told me the club/executive floor is closed for refurbishment. But told me they should have offered me free drink tickets, which I wasnt. Then I overheard at breakfast that the guy sitting next to me was in Club floor. What club floor ? I thought it was closed ?<br/>2) The room they gave me was tiny but bright. Unfortunatley, the key for the safe in the room was missing. Yes, in-room safe need a key rather than the usual key pad. They told me they were in the process of replacing it so I had to be moved to another room.<br/>3) The room they moved me to was at the back of the hotel, with no view, and faces the back of an office block, and worst, the fans of the hotel's air-con system was only 2 or 3 floors down, immediately below my window. It was noisy. The noise went on all the time. The room was about double the size of the first room but dark, and noisy.<br/>4) the room window relies on two little &quot;chocks&quot; to keep it in place. One of them was engaged, but the other one wasnt. So there was a gap between the upper and lower half of the sash window. Called maintenance to get it closed. They managed to close it, and the noise was reduced, but still, noisy.<br/>5) I hate hotels which rely on wifi for in-room internet connection. WIth my laptop which has a weak receiver, it seldom works. After trying for half an hour, calling reception, which put me through to AT+T technical support, I had to get a &quot;high speed bridge&quot; from the reception.<br/>6) The first high speed bridge didnt work. It was dead. They promised to send up a second one but after 15minutes, it didnt come so I had to collect it myself. It worked some further fiddling !! These &quot;high speed bridges&quot; were in their slightly worned out original postal boxes (with stamp and address etc) tucked in a drawer under the reception desk.<br/>7) the towel hook behind the door was bolted to the door with two bolts. One was missing. Surely the cleaner would see that everyday, but why wasnt it repaired? How about wrinkly (i.e. water damaged) piece of in-room menu ?<br/>Its not a bad hotel, but in a good one, everything works ! I probably wont be staying here next time I visit DC. 
73238057	 Nicely kept hotel, spacious room. Bartender gave us free bottled water every night. The location is pretty good but not as close to the mall as we would have liked. Walking wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't during the humid season though. Priceline had a great deal. Call ahead for the valet service so you don't have to wait too long. 
72574759	 This hotel was just what I expected. Walking distance to all of the sites. Comfortable beds and quiet hotel. Decent room service. Three star all the way and perfect for touring DC. 
72309126	 Looking for a short weekend getaway, I quickly realized that weekend rates in Washington are a bargain, but a weeknight (Thursday) in Washington it would cost over $300 for a 3 or 4 star hotel. So, I decided to bid on priceline and was able to get the Crowne Plaza Hamilton (&quot;Downtown White House&quot; location on Priceline) for $120 per night. The location is a close to the subway (about 2 blocks away) or you could walk up from the mall (about 20 minute walk. The room was nicely appointed and although the tub was a bit old, the rest of the washroom had been renovated. There was a nice flatscreen tv in the room as well as coffee maker and I found the staff were helpful and pleasant. Definitely ask for a room away from the main streets as the street traffic definitely was a problem when it came to sleeping. Otherwise, for the price, I was more than satisfied with the Hamilton. As an aside, we moved to the Fairmont Washington for Friday and Saturday (got a great deal for $129 per night on Expedia) and this hotel is magnificient--close to Georgetown shopping, lots of great restaurants, and the hotel is just head and shoulders above the Hamilton. However, the Fairmont on Thursday night would have been $800 per night!! 
72092127	 We recently stayed at the Crowne Plaza, and I cannot say enough about the friendly and professional staff. From the concierge to the management staff, they made us feel welcomed and provided great advice on our sightseeing efforts during the stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are visiting Washington for touring of monuments and memorials. Metro is located nearby, along with many restaurants and things to do. 
87701351	 Stayed here one night, reception and concierge were very friendly and helpful. The room was a standard room, clean and tidy. Getting to the room was more of an issue as the lifts are horrendously slow. As we were Priority Club Gold card members we were given 4 free drink vouchers on check in to use at the bar, so we thought that would be a nice start to the evening, but we were made to feel like unwelcome cheapskates by the barman because of the vouchers. The barman's attitude stopped us from then purchasing any further drinks. Breakfast was of a similar ilk, as we also had free vouchers for this as well. The staff were very untrusting of you, watching your every move as the vouchers only included continental. Many of the tables were left dirty. A great location to see all the highlights of Washington. The nearby metro at McPherson square will take you the Ronald Reagan airport for a few dollars. 
87091711	 Stayed at the Hamilton three days and the location was ideal, the rooms elegant and well appointed. The service was another thing, front desk ignore two specific requests for additional shampoo, and restaurant staff were distant and were uninterested in attending to their guests. 
86641923	 As others have said, this hotel is pretty convenient to the National Mall, White House, etc. It's an easy walk and there are nice restaurants within walking distance. The lobby was nice and the staff were friendly. Our room had issues. It was on the small side (expected in an old hotel) but clean and pretty nicely decorated. However, the lighting overall was very dim and the air conditioning unit was very dusty. The location left much to be desired (Room 334). This is probably the worst room in the hotel as far as location goes. We were behind the elevator bank and had a view of the alley and a bunch of duct work. You could definitely hear noise from the elevators and, if you were a light sleeper, this would be an issue. Also, the rooms have double beds. When I got home I realized that I had booked a room with a park view and a king bed - I forgot that when I got to the hotel. However, it seems they are the same price or that king bed rooms are actually cheaper. Bizarre! There was a fee for WiFi and the valet parking. So add $50 a night to your bill if you plan to use them. We had breakfast both mornings in the restaurant which was very good. Service was friendly, portions were very large, and the food was good. We had drinks and apps in the bar one night. Service was slow - the place was packed and understaffed. Also, the &quot;seasonal&quot; risotto was asparagus. I don't normally think of asparagus as a fall vegetable. Considering the location and price, this is a good spot in DC, but I would definitely request a different room if I went back. 
86478151	 booked room on line-excellant responce<br/>we reached at hotel after whole days tiresome visiting Shenandoah National Park<br/>and were received with warm welcome,<br/>welcome drink was the specility at the hotel<br/>food was excellant,with prompt and courtious room service there<br/>our stay was most comfortable 
86328070	 We were pleased with our stay here. The rooms were a little small and ours was laid out so you were facing the window, not the flat panel TV, but it was fine. We were on a floor far enough up that we didn't have problems with the noise. The bathroom was clean and nicely updated; although space to set and hang things was a little bit of an issue in the bathroom. <br/><br/>The hotel's location was great - a 10 or so minute walk to the White House. It was raining, and we had left our umbrellas in the car ($33+tax for parking), but the front desk had a complimentary umbrella that we were able to use. <br/><br/>The big negatives were the elevator wait. They were like turtles, and at checkout time, it was especially difficult to get one. Also, the &quot;state of the art&quot; fitness center machines needed repair. Only 1 of the 4 treadmills had a working TV. Since each machine had a TV, there was no TV in the fitness center, so it was pretty boring. Speaking of broken things, the complimentary computers weren't working, so we weren't able to print tickets. Lastly, there was no free internet in the room. We weren't in the room much so it wasn't a big deal, and I think it was available in the lobby. There were always people sitting around with their laptops, so that's my guess anyway.<br/><br/>That sounds like a lot of negatives, but I would stay here again. 
86095695	 Stayed two nights in a sold-out town. The staff held up to the pressure--always pleasant and helpful. We were allowed to check in early (10am) and got a great, roomy room. The parking fee was per night, not per hour like some other hotels, which was very nice since we arrived early. <br/><br/>Other reviews have complained about street noise. We were on the street side, but it was nothing unusual for a big city. Only sirens were loud enough to be anything close to a problem, and I had no problem sleeping through them. The room furniture and decor were very nice, and the breakfast buffet on Saturday morning was fantastic--everything you could want, including omelets to order. My only complaint is a common problem--no free internet. My smartphone filled the gap, but I do not understand why every hotel that is half the price includes free wireless, but the most expensive chains continue to charge extra for it. 
219315588	 The Crowne Plaza Hamilton is an excellent choice in DC. Rooms are large and close to government offices, the Mall and the Smithsonian. The rate was reasonable for DC in July. The bed was very comfortable and the bath was very large. We had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel and it was very good. I had read some negative reviews of the restaurant but we did not find anything wrong. We sat outside and aside from some loud motorcycles, it was very pleasant. The bar is also a great choice and the food in the bar is just as good. The only negative was the limited room service menu. Wifi is free to IHG members. The only problem was the wifi would timeout too often.<br/><br/>My spouse had to wait for me in the lobby with our luggage while I finished some business and the bell staff were very accommodating with storing the luggage and pulling bags/putting them back as needed during the afternoon. <br/><br/>The Hamilton is a great choice in DC. 
218621384	 Stayed here for 2 nights in June 2014. Location is good - not far to walk to major sights. i went running both mornings down by the White House/Lincoln Memorial and it was easy to get there from the hotel. One downside is that the hotel overlooks a small park lined with benches where a lot of homeless people sleep. I went running alone at 6am and didn't feel completely safe.<br/><br/>the rooms were as you'd expect from a crowne plaza - nice, spacious and comfortable. my room had some very loud aircon though which i just had to get used to.<br/><br/>i arrived late at night and wanted to facetime people at home. the wifi in my room didn't work despite an engineer coming to try to fix it. apparently that room 'doesn't get a very good signal' so it was a case of tough luck. the next morning however the front desk told me another wifi account to log into and the problem was solved. its a shame they didn't just tell me that in the first place.<br/><br/>i had one meal in the hotel bar whilst i watched some world cup football. the bar had a nice atmosphere, staff were friendly and the food was good.<br/><br/>overall i would probably stay here again. the central location and reasonable price were great. 
218172490	 My friend and I stayed in Washington's plush Hamilton Crowne Plaza Hotel during our recent trip to Washington. The room was spacious, with a luxury bathroom and two giant double beds. If I had one gripe then it would be that WIFI was not free in the bedrooms but to be fair, this is a very small gripe and free WIFI is offered in many nearby cafés and restaurants.<br/>The hotel's location is very central for exploring Washington's MANY free sights. Washington is like a walking history book - there's loads to see and do there! The best part is that the majority of the city's museums are free so that's a big plus! Before I digress too much (since I'm reviewing the hotel rather than the city), it's located just across the road from McPherson Square Subway Station and this was very handy for us when we were travelling from the Airport as we didn't have to lug our luggage too far when we arrived at the Subway Station.<br/>It was expensive to dine at the hotel's restaurant so we opted to eat in other nearby eateries. In Washington, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to eating options and if you're any bit budget-conscious then it is very possible to eat on a budget there.<br/>I think that Tony Browne at the Concierge deserves a special mention as he was extremely helpful; providing us with maps, tour-bus tickets, and other information about the city.<br/>I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to friends or family. 
217866505	 The hotel staff was excellent. The concierge was very good and took time to answer all of our questions. Made some great recommendations and clearly made our trip great.<br/>Close to everything walking distance.<br/>Would stay again.<br/>Room was clean 
217833982	 Customer service can ruin, an otherwise outstanding hotel. It costs seven times more to get a new customer than retain an existing. As an IHG Platinum for the last 2 years, I decided to take my wife to DC for a short vacation using Rewards Points. Arrived late in evening and assigned Room 1444, which in the course of evening we learned wraps around the elevator bank sounding like you're in the machinery room. Guest services made a follow up call the next day to see how my experience was, and I shared the noise issue, assuming the very nice person was documenting my concern. I expected at lease an apology note from the Manager, but nothing! My business doesn't require me to use IHG when I travel, I HAD BEEN MAKING A CHOICE. 
217435308	 An excellent choice! I enjoyed this hotel pretty much. The hotel does not seem big, but this even adds some charm. My room (though not very large) was very cute and cozy, which indeed allow me feeling at home. <br/><br/>There is a number of cool restaurants and bars around (one should definitely visit Joe's), the White House is a couple of blocks down, which makes the hotel perfectly situated. 
117318329	 Lovely historic hotel next to Franklin Park. Great, spacious room, very clean and comfortable. Bathroom amazing, quite large and lots of marble. The staff were very helpful and the desk guy let me use his computer terminal to check in for my flight next day even though I told him it would take ages. My only quibble is that there must have been a water pipe above the room, because you could hear the hum of pipes at night. However I did check with another guest and their room was fine, so I guess it's just luck. Priority club members can have a discounted breakfast or free wifi. Would recommend. 
117054344	 This was a decent middle-of-the-road restaurant. I was quite impressed by the staff. They were very friendly and attentive. However, I do think people need to know that right across the side street is a park that seems to be a regular hangout / home for homeless people. 
116959675	 Even though the price of all the hotels in DC is expensive. It cost the same rewards points as other crowne plaza hotels in other location, and I stayed by reward points for a night.<br/><br/>I got upgraded to junior suite for Elite Status Member. The room was beyond my expectation. The room is big and nice. Even though this is a historic hotel, everything is as new as newly furnished. The service was nice too.<br/><br/>For location, it is in safe area and close to the subway and bus. Also, it's few blocks from national monuments. I'd like to choose it again if I ever came back to visit this area.<br/><br/>*Internet is free for Platinum Elite Priority Member 
116849381	 Stayed for one day. Location is really great - 3 blocks from the White House. The service is as expected from the Holiday Inn chain (Priority Club status adds value as well).<br/>I would recommend them to upgrade safe deposit box to laptop size - currently it is too small with old-style key)<br/>Bathroom is clean, although may be renovated.<br/>Bus 52 to IAD airport just across the street (then bus 5A) - for those who don't like taxi. On Saturday it was great value for money. 
116802786	 I stayed at the Crowne Hamilton for 2 nights on business and while there are a number of good points about the hotel (central location, pleasant decor, price), it falls short on several items mostly related to service. <br/><br/>1. After a long day, I phoned down to the front desk to ask for a wake-up call the next day at 7:45 AM. Instead, I received one at 6:30 AM. <br/><br/>2. Both telephones in the room had so much static on the line that I couldn't hear the person I was speaking to on the other end. I called down to ask the hotel to repair/replace the telephones and was assured that this would happen. It did not. I could not use my room phone as a result for my entire stay.<br/><br/>3. The satellite reception on the television kept cuttting in and out constantly. I know it was not only my room as several other individuals staying in the hotel mentionned the same thing.<br/><br/>4. The A/C system was extremely loud (and I've stayed in a ton of hotels) - bring earplugs if you plan on staying here.<br/><br/>5. Maid service replaced only half of the toiletries that I finished. Luckily, I had brought my own just in case as I was sick of calling down to complain about things. <br/><br/>6. Restaurant is way overpriced for what you get in terms of quality. I don't mind laying out some good coin for gourmet cuisine, but this is not what I got. Food was okay, but not gourmet. Presentation was elementary. Service was average. Definitely not worth the money. <br/><br/>On the positive side, prior to checking out, I was asked about my stay and, as a result, was given a small adjustment on my bill. This was nice and I appreciated it, but I would rather have had proper service and a room not in need of repair. 
116751844	 We stayed here for 3 nights in April and 3 nights in August. We had a nice room in April, but we had difficulties with the internet. I had to spend time on the phone with tech support to get things to work &amp; then the wireless connection in the room was bad. At the time we decided to not stay there if internet access was crucial, but we did stay again in August because of the good rates &amp; I get points.<br/> We were greeted at check in by one of the rudest front desk clerks of all time. Our room was not ready so she said come back later. We asked to at least check in so we only had to pick up key later, which is what happens at most hotels; she relented (after we asked to speak to the manager) and we did check in. When we came back for the key she handed us the folder with the keys &amp; said nothing, not even the room number. At that point we asked to see the front office manager (Simone) and complained about the rude service. It turns out we had been given a room with double beds, not a king as requested. If the original clerk had checked this could have been fixed with no problem. Simone did upgrade our room and later sent up chocolate-covered strawberries to make amends.<br/> So here comes the internet again. I had to call tech support (I’m using a Macbook) and after 10 minutes I am set, but the room is in someone else’s name so I can’t log in! I called the desk &amp; they said to log in as the other person and they’d fix it later. The next morning I count breakfast coupons and they gave us the wrong number. Later that day my key stopped working in the elevator &amp; again the internet problem arose. This time after spending 40 min on the phone ATT discovers that it is a problem (no welcome page) for the entire hotel. I hang up with ATT and call the front office; they had no idea the internet was not working and said they would call me back. Well that did not happen. I called them to only be placed on hold &amp; forgotten. I made headway with the second call and was told yes the internet is not working for new logins. I did get on about 4 hours later.<br/> We gave the hotel 3 stars because the weekend rate was great and staff other than the first clerk tried to be helpful, but we will not stay here again. 
94670138	 The Hotel will bend over backwards to make sure your stay is a pleasant one. The Staff at the front desk and the staff in the Restaurant/bar were very cordial. I did not feel as a customer, but a guest.<br/><br/>The location is across from a park, two blocks from the Metro and has a drug store, shoe repair and bakery within a block. Plus, many restaurants within walking distance. 
94374860	 We spent three nights here. The room was on a corner and a bit cramped by US standards, but OK. Breakfast was good and we had dinner one evening which was fine. We felt comfortable and enjoyed our stay. It's a fair walk to the subway, but there are also plenty of buses including a cross town one that goes by the hotel. 
93612353	 The Hamilton is an older, but updated hotel, in a great location. The beginning of our trip was business which kept us in National Harbor, which there is not much to see there. So to enjoy the DC area we booked the hotel by naming our price on Priceline. We ended up booking a $100 rate! Trying to book on the Crowne Plaza website, they are demanding $280+, which all value is lost for that amount. <br/><br/>It is older, which means everything is smaller, but still it is a beautiful hotel. The service was top notch through out minus the belle service. They seemed more bothered by there job than wanting to help. The front desk was always friendly and eager to help. The front desk agent upgraded our room view to look over the park and Washington Monument. He also told us a little bit about the area. The concierge was very friendly and graciously helped us out on dinner reservations one night. <br/><br/>The rooms is somewhat tight but not too bad. The rooms are well appointed with iPod dock, safe and black out curtains. The bathroom is extremely tight. It's not possible for two to get ready in their bathrooms, even thought it is smartly designed, still too small. <br/><br/>The Hamilton has a great bar just off the lobby with a few TVs to catch the games. There is also a Starbucks attached for those that need their daily fix. This location is a busy one on weekdays. <br/><br/>Overall, the Hamilton is a great location for the sight seers. It is within walking distance to all the major sites. It's two blocks from the sub station and across the street from the Georgetown Circulator bus line. Book this hotel anywhere but the hotels website for the best deal. 
93276138	 Hotel is above average with a few rough edges. <br/>Room was comfortable and clean. Weekend price was great $89 a night from Travelzoo. Even AAA rate was about $120. Not bad for DC.<br/>All the staff were pleasant. And generally said hior smiled when you passed.<br/><br/>Had dinner one night in their restaurant 14K. Very tasty food and attentive service from Jean.<br/><br/>Now the gotchas: The neighborhood is noisy on Friday and Saturday night. Lots of late night clubs so beware if you are light sleeper because sirens and noise are frequent late in the evening (1 to 4 AM). If that is the case don't get a Park View room. <br/><br/>If you want to go clubing this is your place. They did provide ear plugs and a sleep mask. Not sure if everyone gets them or just Priority Club Members.<br/><br/>The room had a safe but &quot;the last guest had accidentally taken the key&quot; so it was useless. Their solution was put my laptop in the safety deposit boxes behind the desk. If a hotel is going to have a safe in the room then make it easy for the guest to use. Apparently most of the safes are missing keys is the impression I got because I was warned key may be missing when I checked in. The front desk staff either have heard this complaint one too many times or they really weren't interested. Not sure which.<br/><br/>The valet service to get out the car took normally at least 15 minutes so plan ahead and also the rate was $36 per night. So that put a bit of a damper on the room bargain. Moral of story don't bring your car to DC. Take the train or fly and use cabs.<br/><br/>Overall an above average older hotel for DC. 
91465201	 The exterior of the hotel, the lobby, as well as the holiday decorations were all beautiful! The location of the hotel is not the type where everything is at your doorsteps, however the hotel is within walking distance to many of the more popular neighborhoods of DC. The unpleasant experiences I encountered included: the hotel's bathroom containing stains on both the floor and wall, and also the street noise from the bedroom despite being on a high floor of the hotel. Despite these few issues, the hotel's beauty and charm made my first trip to DC one I will never forget! 
91026962	 Upgraded to club(?) level floor... where there is an open lounge with free breakfast and hors d'oeurves. Not too bad. Room was very nice, regular room but not noisy, good decor and comfortable. <br/><br/>Location is the best, i can walk to ronald reagan building where all my meetings were. <br/><br/>DC is pricey and I think this hotel is affordable in comparison to many of the other hotels in town 
131088944	 We were very happy with our four-night stay and look forward to visiting this hotel again. Easy walk to the White House Visitor Center, Washington Monument, Elipse, Smithsonian American History and Natural History Museums. A little longer, but very nice walk to the Lincoln Memorial or the Tidal Basin peddle boats. One nice surprise was the wonderful 14K restaurant. Excellent food and very family friendly for such a lovely place. They have a reasonably-priced kids menu (menu has activities and comes with crayons), and a nice happy hour from 4-7, so momma could have a $4 glass of wine with our early dinner and the whole thing didn't cost much more than our meal in the cafeteria at the Smithsonian. There is a CVS with a small grocery section down the street from the hotel, where we picked up individual cereals for the kids and milk that we kept in the ice bucket (no mini fridge). A nice bonus - we could see the Washington Monument from our room. The room was a touch run down (frayed carpet), but very clean and considering the location and friendliness of the staff, this didn't bother me at all and we won't hesitate to return. 
131016913	 I stayed at that hotel for two nights at the end of May 2012. Great location, indeed, ca. 15 minutes on foot to the White House, etc. Lobby is mid-size, a bit closed in with too many columns. Room was nice, had all the necessary items. Good bed, flat screen tv, no fridge, air conditioning worked well, bathroom nice, good decor all around. However, the toilet was hissing every 10 minutes. Called the front desk (early in the morning, shortly after my arrival at ca. 12 a.m.), and we agreed that they would fix it later. Came back in the evening, nothing had been done. Called again, repair man appeared, claimed then to have fixed it. Ten minutes later problem continued. Repair man reappeared, could not fix it. So I shut off the valve altogether. Temporary solution. Light switch in the bathroom at the worst possible place, hidden at the inside wall next to the sink. Took me a while to find it in the dark. Breakfast not included, wifi not included, everything is charged. Found a coffee shop around the corner with free wifi. Come on guys, what is wrong with you hotel owners nowadays? Free wifi is basic and standard. Altogether, good hotel, but not super special and all working fine. Room charge paid by my organization, but it was ca. $140 a night. Probably not bad for downtown DC, but I would have expected a little more for that money. My window went out to the back area, simply grim. But perhaps that gave me more peace at night? 
130900344	 Pleasant hotel with good staff welcoming and helping you. Comfy beds. Close to metro and walking distance to sights. Need good pair of walking shoes for other sights further away or take the metro. 
130896313	 My husband and I purchased a Travelzoo deal for an overnight stay. I called ahead to see if we could check in early and though the answer was yes, the gentleman I spoke with on the phone was rather curt. When we arrived, our room was ready early, as we had anticipated and we were greeted professionally and fairly courteously. The room was lovely, if small, but quiet, and with a comfortable bed and clean facilities. Our only problem was the service. We stayed in the hotel for not quite 24 hours and we had 4 concerns:<br/>1. The valet brought the wrong car, even though we called 30min in advance--not such a big deal, but then it took another 10 minutes for them to get the correct one...<br/>2. The maid knocked on our door at 8:30am to ask us what time we planned to leave. We've stayed in lots of places and my husband travels extensively for work--we have never been disrupted in the morning by someone from the cleaning staff to ask when we plan to depart so that they can clean our room for the next guest.<br/>3. The phones in our room didn't work in the morning.<br/>4. When we left (i.e. my husband had just gotten outside to the valet), as the valet was loading a bag in our car, he told my husband &quot;You need to go ahead and move the car--it's rush hour.&quot; My husband replied that he was waiting for his wife and the valet just shrugged dismissively and said &quot;well, they ticket here.&quot;<br/><br/>Independently, none of these are really a big deal--mistakes and technical difficulties do happen), but each time, it just depreciated the value of the service. Why pay for $40 valet car service if the valets can't be bothered to monitor the vehicles? And really does the maid need to interrupt us when we're not anywhere near the checkout time?<br/><br/>It seems like the staff simply needs a reiteration of what high quality service is--that issue is addressed at the management level and it seems that someone just wasn't on top of it.<br/><br/>Overall, we enjoyed our stay, but we would not go back to the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. Glad we didn't pay the regular $300/nt rate. 
130858232	 We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The first night we were on the front of the building with a park view, but it was very noisy and we could not sleep. Next night the front desk moved us to a room in the back, no view, but very quiet. Booked through travelzoo (99.00) with a very low rate so I have no complaints. I do think there are better hotels in DC if I had to pay rack rate. Hotel is well located and has metro access very close. Area was nice and I saw very few homeless as commented in other reviews. We easily walked to white house and mall. CVS across the street if needed. Staff was very personable and helpful with any request. My only annoyances were the fact that it takes 1/2 hour to get car from valet, but they tell you this upfront and the beds are very soft and &quot;bouncy&quot;. I would stay here again with the same rate. 
130742408	 I spent the Memorial Weekend in DC and my stay at the Crown Plaza Hamilton was great. The staff (especially Christopher Brown) at check in made me feel, that i had definately booked the best place for my trip. The food and service at the hotel resturant was superb. The location was outstanding (many notable sights were within walking distance). The workout room was one of the best I've seen in a while. A very accommodating place to stay. 
5612750	 The Hamilton Crowne Plaza is well-located to McPherson Square and directly across the street from Franklin Square, This makes in a nice alternate in that area if you have events at the Grand Hyatt or the Renaissance Washington, two larger convention hotels that are within about a six-block walk. The finish at the CP Hamilton is nice and housekeeping seems decent, but the hotel's overall culture of service seems to be spotty. (Don't expect any extras for being platinum PC, for example.) <br/><br/>On the plus side, we liked the streetside outdoor seating for the restaurant and we were able to the get toothbrushes replaced that the maid kindly threw away for us after the first night. There was a $109/night weekend rate available during our stay which is certainly a bargain for this quality of property in Washington DC. It is convenient to the metro system, too. The neighborhood itself has some amenities such as places to eat or grab a cup of coffee, but it is certainly not as well-blessed with these as the Dupont Circle neighborhood.<br/><br/>Negative aspects include the internet service provided by Wayport Access, a third-party vendor. We found it very intermittent and at $9.95 per day, certainly no bargain for the very mediocre service. We could open the window in our room, but it is one of those annoying systems that maxes out at about two inches. <br/><br/>In summary, the Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a decent hotel, but not one that we would put on our &quot;must return&quot; list in Washington. For a good rate, it's not a bad choice.<br/> 
5497981	 I stayed in this hotel the weekend the blizzard hit the east coast and snowed everybody in. I'd been at the Omni Shoreham all week and stayed at The Hamilton hotel my last night in Washington -- I'm glad I did, as I enjoyed The Hamilton much more than the Omni. The hotel appeared to have been renovated recently, and though my room was a bit small, it was cozy and comfortable. I had a great view of the park below and I felt secure inside the hotel. The room was very clean and had a comfortable bed. I had to pay for 24 hours' access to the Internet (wireless), but the speed was fast and enabled me to get some good work done while watching the snow fall outside. The proximity of this hotel to the Metro (one block) makes it ideal. It also is close to many of the sites in Washington, but as my trip was business I did not have time for many of them. It's not too far of a walk from Old Ebbitt Grill -- I recommend strolling down there for a cup of clam chowder if it's cold outside.<br/> 
5352187	 This hotel is a find. The rooms are not small by European standards. And, it really is good value by European standards (and even American ones). The carpets were new and nice. The breakfast was excellent, thanks to superb, ripe, sweet fresh fruit. The staff were friendly - but it sure helped to speak Spanish to them. The operator managed to misdirect incoming calls intended for me to other's room which was unlikely to be welcome at 5:45 a.m. They have a floor for &quot;single women&quot; which requires it's own key card to access in the elevator. Disappointingly, my glasses were taken away with the bed sheets, but, this, certainly, was not the hotel's fault. The bed was comfortable. Hotel has a classic appearance from the outside, and is well located for walking to the convention center (aobut four blocks) or for the metro. Alas, no swimming pool.<br/> 
5236607	 I was interested in reserving a room at this hotel. When I contacted the hotel to make my reservation, they informed me that there would be a $500 refundable deposit for having a small dog in the room. I asked what would happen if our dog had an 'accident'. The receptionist was very polite and said she would make a call and find out. She had me 'on hold' for a brief moment. On her return, she said politely that it was an 'all or nothing fee' - we would lose our $500 deposit. The highest deposit I have ever seen has been $100. We did not make our reservation.<br/> 
5190980	 We stayed at the Hamilton Hotel for one night in mid-May. We were pleasantly surprised. We thought the hotel was an excellent value. The rooms are a lot nicer in person than depicted on the website. The hotel had been tastefully redecorated several years ago and it has been kept up well. The best part was the burger from room service. It was excellent ! We would definitely stay here again. The rooms are not overly large but they are very pleasant. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was oversupplied with clean towels. The room and bathroom were clean. Everything worked. The staff if not overly solicitous was certainly friendly. We have no qualms in recommending this hotel. Yeah, it is NOT the Mandarin Oriental. But at half the price, it was great. This is an excellent value if you want a nice room, great location, AND don't want to spend $400 a night.<br/> 
5047455	 Stayed here 5-7 May 2006. Very elegant hotel. Staff not overly friendly or helpful except bell boy. Good size room with bath in bathroom. Very comfy bed. Really loud air conditioning in the room which we didn't mind (white noise) but some might find annoying. Close to several subway locations which was handy. Washington DC is the most gorgeous city, we loved it. 2 days was not enough. Monuments at night tour is highly recommended. Also leave some time to explore Arlington Cemetery - although a sad place, it is beautiful, peaceful and full of amazing history. Try to fly in and out of Ronald Reagan (National) Airport. It is on the subway line and much close and easier than Dulles.<br/> 
129091080	 We stayed here again on another business trip to DC. Hotel is charming and in a great location at 14th and K Streets. Staff was friendly. Room was in back of hotel, which did not have a great view, but we quickly realized that it was better than being in the front of the hotel, as in the back you do not hear the taxi cabs being whistled for and you do not have the noise of the street. Room was clean, nicely decorated. Food at restaurant is fantastic; however, staff could use some better training. They just need to be a little more attentive to their tables. We went there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner over various days and were neglected water and bread and had to ask for it on a few occasions, and a did not have a general checking up on the table on most occasions. Nothing that would keep me from returning, but something to keep in mind if you are looking to be truly be waited on. We will definitely be back. 
128861572	 For a family of 6 sightseeing in DC, this was a decent choice. If it wasn't for the one elevator only serving the hotel, I would have added one more star. Within walking dostance to lots of attractions, cafes and restaurants. If taking taxis, wouldn't cost much to visit the further ones. Good staff and there is something about the hotel that is just loveable, probably the feeling that it has histroy in it. Some of the rooms have great view over the park and further the Washington Monuments. The rooms are spacious. 
128482853	 I stayed here overnight with my boyfriend for an all-expenses paid trip I won to see Robin Thicke in a private concert. The staff was very attentive to our needs from beginning to need. When we arrived, the attendant walked right up to our cab to help us with our bags. The front desk clerks were polite and assisted with switching one of our room keys that didn't work. When we checked out the next day, another attendant used a whistle to hail as cab for us...the coolest thing ever (I need one of those)! The room appeared clean and elegantly comfortable...not in a posh contemporary way, but in an old world way. The room was next to the elevator, in a corner adjacent to another one and I thought the layout was odd. There was a long hallway leading into the bedroom, which took away from space in that area. The bathroom was spacious and had updates fixtures. The bed was comfortable and made for a good night's sleep. When the front desk clerk asked if we would mind having a room near the elevator (which was the only way available at the time), I thought it wouldn't be a big deal. But as a fairly light sleeper, the rumble of the cart moving up and down the shaft woke me up quite a few times. Unfortunately, our &quot;view&quot; consisted of an office building, but it wasn't a big deal since we were only there for one night. This hotel is conveniently located to many restaurants and clubs (The Park at 14th is right down the street) and is a brisk walk or a short cab drive away from Chinatown, The White House, and the National Mall. All in all, it was a good stay. I don't know if I'd pay the regular rate, but I would definitely recommend it if your budget allows for it. 
128392199	 Just got back from this hotel today and we loved our stay there. <br/><br/>It's in a great location, just one block from McPherson subway station, bus stops right outside and about 3-4 blocks walk away from the White House. There weren't a great deal of places near by to eat though so be prepared to travel a little further afield for food in the evening. That said, the DC restaurant that is over the road from the hotel was good, and the hotel food itself was also good. We ate in the bar one evening (happy hour 4-7 includes bar food half price) and in the restaurant one evening - free wine when you order a main course... they know how to incentivise!! The Sunday breakfast buffet also offered really good value and there was a good selection.<br/><br/>Our room was lovely. We were upgraded to a junior suite which had tons of room. The hotel itself is very nicely decorated, very clean and modern, but classically styled. This goes through to the rooms too.<br/><br/>The staff were really friendly and very helpful. They couldn't do enough for you. <br/><br/>I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I was in DC.<br/><br/>My one 'must do' DC tip is the Segway tour. Right over the other side of Franklin Square (right outside the hotel) is the segway tour office. This was so much fun and the best way to see the sights. You go round the capital building, the mall, the washington monument, the whitehouse and tons more. I now want a Segway!! 
128321488	 the service speak very bad english, for example the valet-service. Little room, very loud air-condition, Breakfast poor, waiter level for 2 stars hotel. Holiday Inn is better. 
128308942	 I stayed in DC for five days and spent my stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. I have nothing but nice things to say about it, too. The hotel is very elegant and has a lovely feel to it. The rooms were a good size and the bathrooms were, too. The rooms were decorated very well. The staff was very nice and helpful, offering suggestions for restaurants and more. It was also a very convenient location. It was a couple blocks from the White House and a mile from the Mall. It was only a block and a half from the metro and you could take the blue line to almost anywhere in the city. The hotel was also attached to a Starbucks which is always a plus. I'd stay there again any day! I loved it! 
177648679	 One night stay in the city for a Mystics game. Nice older hotel, very antique feel, old city type themes. Courteous staff, quick check-in, mention of IHG status, and added breakfast and free Wifi as perks. Couldn't take advantage of the breakfast because of an early departure, but Wifi was quick and efficient. Room was SMALL. Very comfortable bed. Modern furniture, nice city view of the park across the street. Felt like NYC. But we spent about 6 hours actually in the room, just for sleep really, so can't complain. Had drinks at the bar, Sam was very nice. Didn't eat any food. Valets were very attentive, needed to hail a few taxis and they were right on it. All in all, I would recommend and stay here again. 
177560978	 We had a wonderful trip to DC and the Hamilton Crowne Plaza was the icing on the cake. The hotel is nicely appointed with modern furnishings, clean and in a great location (1 block from the metro). The staff was extremely helpful and organized. We were able to get a good deal on the room since it was after Labor Day which really helped. We also paid a littld extra for the room so we could have breakfast included. This was well worth the money especially since we were travelling with our 9 year old daughter. The only items to keep in mind is the rooms are a bit small and even though we were on the 9th floor with a nice view the traffic could be loud so ask for a room away from the main road. We would definitely stay here again. 
177365071	 Arrival: We arrived at about 7pm on a Friday evening. The hotel was busy but they had plenty of front desk staff to check-in guests. The check-in staff member was friendly and we ended up getting a free upgrade to a King Executive Suite on the top floor of the hotel. <br/><br/>Room: The room was amazing. We had a living room with separate bedroom. The room appeared to have been updated recently. The living room had a &quot;L&quot; shaped sofabed, desk, flat screen TV, fridge, coffee maker and plenty of storage. There were three large windows with a great view of the Washington Monument and the city. The bedroom had a king size bed, flat screen TV and was nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable and nice to lay on to watch TV. Overall the room exceeded our expectations.<br/><br/>Side note: The night we arrived we received a notice saying the engineering department would be doing some work on the roof and a crane would be blocking the street on Saturday morning. We were a little concerned about noise being on the top floor of the hotel but we heard very little that morning. The crane was there for a few hours but really caused no issues at all.<br/><br/>Parking: Parking at the Hamilton is $45 a night, which for Washington DC is very average. Prior to arriving we used a parking finder website and found out there is a 24 hour parking garage about a half a block away, at 13th and K Street. They charge $27 for 24 hours. So we parked there instead of using the hotels valet parking. To access the garage on weekends and after hours you have to go down the vehicle entry ramp but Monday through Friday you can access the garage through the office building right next to the hotel. Also another parking tip, meter parking in DC is free on Sundays. Also if you buy a parking ticket from one of the newer machines you can prepay ahead for parking. So on Sunday you can still purchase two hour parking for Monday morning, so that way you can pay for parking the night before and not have to wake up early to feed a parking meter. Of course after 10pm Monday - Saturday you can do the same thing pay for two hours of parking for the next day.<br/><br/>Location: The hotel is located in a perfect spot, only about four blocks to the white house and eight or so blocks to the museum/mall area. We walked from the hotel to the Smithsonian Castle and didn't feel it was a long walk at all. We also walked to the White House in the evening to get some night picture of the White House and felt safe while doing so. The area does have a large population of homeless in the park across the street from the hotel but at no time did we feel unsafe or harassed by anyone.<br/><br/>Overall we loved our stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza Hotel in Washington DC. The room was exceptional, staff were always friendly and the location is perfect for exploring Washington DC. We would highly recommend this hotel to others. 
177252709	 We stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza while tourists in DC. It is in a great location with helpful, efficient staff. We had a problem with our reservation that was rectified quickly and effectively with pleasure by the staff. Had drinks in the bar each night &amp; the staff were friendly and helpful. The room was a bit small but it was clean and comfortable. The shower was great. We had a great stay in DC. 
176882537	 We just visited DC for the firts time and really enjoyed our stay at the Hamilton Crown Plaza. Very clean hotel. Hotel concierge was very professional and informative about getting around the city and recommended awsome restaurant to eat. Would definitely stay again. 
176845042	 A frequent traveler to DC, I'd never stayed at the Hamilton, but I sure to take advantage of this gem in the future. Due to its proximity to the MacPherson Square Metro (1/1/2) blocks and many fabulous restaurants including their own 14K on site, this definitely ranks them in my top 2 hotels in The District. (the other being the Willard). Room was very very nice and the staff really made me feel welcome and like an honored guest.<br/><br/>Say Hi to Sam, 14K's world famous bartender, for me!<br/><br/>Scotty V 
70738058	 I booked 2 rooms in April for our July visit so I could take advantage of the &quot;advanced booking rate&quot;. In May I noticed that I could have got the rooms $80 cheaper (still at the advanced rate) When I emailed I was told that the hotels are privately run and they could not help me although they are part of the IHG group of hotels. To add insult to injury we were told on arrival that only one room was paid for and my son's card was debited with $800 which we could not believe. We had to show them an online copy of my credit card bill before they would reverse the $800 charge - this took 3 days. Throughout our trip we stayed at 4 other hotels all of which were much better in both price, space and value &amp; helpfulness of staff. Will NEVER stay at another Crowne Plaza Hotel!! 
69902885	 I will be attending the Society of Wine Educators Conference at the Hotel. According to the conference brochure they had negotiated a $129 rate. The Hotel would not honor that rate and gave a rate over $300 a night. To me that is bait and switch. Out of principle I did not book the room. I am in the hospitality industry and would never treat my guests that way. If $300 is the rate advertise that. Be honest. 
69264813	 WOW! What can I say. We loved it! We booked through Priceline so had a phenomonal price to begin with, then when we get there, they have offered to put us into their junior suite since we'll be there 5 nights. Any of you who've used Priceline know that you need to be prepared for sleeping next to the elevator or ice machine - we've never been treated like this. The junior suite was gorgeous. Everything was impeccable, it was like having an apartment in the city. Even the AC was so quiet, just like at home - not one of those in the wall units. The staff was always considerate and helped us with anything everyday. Breakfast in the lovely restaurant each morning was terrific. We eat healthy, and they remembered us and always had the best oatmeal ready with fresh raisins to add and a side of egg whites freshly prepared. At night the bar was such a nice stop before slipping into the perfectly made bed - ahhhhh. Thank you Hamilton, you're in our hearts for good. 
69095644	 All as advertised. Metro 1.5 blocks away. Note: you will see homeless at night in nearby park and sleeping in front of closed shops. I didn't count, but I'd guess it's about 8 blocks to the White House, and about 6 to Old Ebbitt Grill, a nice place for a late night drink or snack. Nice large room, very comfortable beds, nice showers. Room service was prompt with a request for another pillow and an ice bucket (someone had taken ours!). Would stay again. 
67711511	 I stayed at the Hamilton (Crown Plaza) two nights while in town for a conference and I thought it was great! I got a terrific rate through Priceline. The room was small but it had everything I need -- big comfortable bed, workable desk, big flat screen TV and clean bathroom. Great water pressure in the shower, by the way. And 1-1/2 blocks to the Metro. <br/><br/>I'd definitely go back again! 
67525963	 I spent 1 night here this past weekend and had a pleasant and comfortable stay. Overall, if you get a good price, I'd highly recommend it. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) There were some cleanliness issues I noticed no sooner I entered the room (some hair on the bathroon floor), but I reported it to the front desk and it was immediately taken care of. 2) I found the room to be quite warm. 3) There are several homeless people in nearby Franklin Square (across the street).<br/><br/>Pros: <br/>1) Another reviewer complained about a smell in the lobby - I didn't notice any smell. In fact, I thought the lobby was quite nice and the hotel, in general, was tastefully decorated! 2) The orange and blue metro lines get you to McPherson Square and from there it's a short walk to the hotel. 3) It was a short walk to the White House and the Mall and other attractions were not much farther. 4) The circulator bus stop is diagonally across from the hotel and this bus takes you to Union Station (convenient for those who travel by Amtrak). 5) There is a restaurant/bar and a Starbucks attached to the hotel. 6) Some reviewers complained about the small size of the room - I stayed in a room with a king-sized bed and found the room to be a decent size. 
190916506	 Usually I stay twice in a year on my business trips in Washigton. Confortable and spacious rooms, nice bar, good restaurant, starbucks in the morning, cozy location. Wonderful choice to stay in Washington. Maybe a bit impersonal but professionally impeccable. 
190775817	 I needed to be downtown DC for early meetings and found an amazing pre-pay rate of $105/night on hotel.com. What a value! The rooms are newly appointed, spacious and quite lovely. The hallways are quiet and the staff is extremely accommodating. I was delighted to find that the rooms are equipped with refrigerators! 
190558525	 We booked this hotel online knowing that it was in a very good location. The rate they were offering was also attractive for our family of as we needed a Jr. Suite over the New Years. I cant say enough about the ind staff from the front of the house (Valet, Bellmen, front desk) to the concierge named Louis. He was exceptional before we even got there. I had called to ask if there was anything special for New years eve and when we got there he had prepared a package for us in the room with all the different events for first night, collateral as well as all the possible restaurants in and around the hotel. The valet even washed our car when we gave it to them to park because it had gone through some rough terrain/storms on the way to DC. Again, the hotel was quiet, the room was exactly as it was shown in the pictures, fresh, new feeling with a good size bathroom. Housekeeping always made sure we had enough towels as well and never disturbed us when the DND sign was left on the door. It is close to everything one needs to see in DC (either walking i.e. White House, State Dept, Elipse etc etc) and if you like to walk, as another contributor mentioned (Eugene D), just go North and you will see those beautiful churches...we ventured a little more and hit P street and on your left on P street you will also find Whole Foods. We had a couple of breakfasts there as it was easy to jump in the car, park in there free parking lot and grab a nice hot BK. All in all...We would stay here again. 
190218548	 My family was here for a short stay to see the 4th of July fireworks, and we only stayed one night. We booked a reward night room and were given an upgrade to a suite on one of the top floors. The suite was very large and comfortable with a great view. The bathroom was a bit small but that is to be expected with an older hotel. We also were given conceirge level and had breakfast there the morning after our stay. The location is great. It is only a block from a metro station and we also walked into DC. It took about 15 minute to walk to the back of the White House. We paid for valet, overnight parking, which was expected in a metro area. The staff was very nice and we felt very welcome. I loved the convenience and being right in the city. I would definitely return. 
189562544	 This hotel is conveniently located a few blocks from the White House and only a couple of miles from the National Mall, so it is in the heart of D.C. downtown area. In addition to the typical sightseeing for Washington D.C., i would also recommend you walk north a block or two for amazing churches devoid of tourists (truly a gem for D.C.).<br/>One of the major perks of this hotel is the room+parking option, which is a great value! It may not be available on typical online reservation websites, though, so consider calling the hotel directly.<br/>As for the interior, the hotel is housed in an old building, yet it strives to deliver lovely ambience and typical room amenities a guest would expect from Crowne Plaza class of hotel.<br/>All in all, this hotel offers very good value for money. 
189160450	 Stayed at the Hamilton over Christmas week with a family or 5 and highly recommend it. Walking distance to the Mall and a short taxi ride to the Zoo. We were very happy with the rooms and the included breakfast was amazing. Best of all were the staff !!! Better service then almost any hotel we ever stayed in and we have stayed in many top end hotels, but they beat them all. By the way they allow small pets to stay on the 3rd floor, so we brought our little dog. There is a park right across the street when we needed to walk the dog.<br/><br/>This hotel is first class and a bargain to boot. Dont even bother to look elsewehere in Washington DC. 
214635740	 we stayed in room #943. it was small. maybe the smallest room we stayed for last years except the cruise boat cabin at Galapagos. at the same time the room was very comfortable and had all we needed for 2 adults and 1 kid. we used the sofa as extra bed for our daughter and she slept excellent. the hotel looks freshly renovated. our room was very clean and new. the view from our window was nothing, but we did not expect much. we tried a complimentary 'breakfast' for Gold IHG members at the 12 floor. coffee was good there. breakfast at the ground floor restaurant was much better. we also went for dinner to K14 and really enjoyed it. there is a McCormick&amp;Schmicks 7 minutes walking - great seafood as usual 
214453650	 After arriving at the Marriott and being told they overbooked so our confirmed reservation was worthless, we ended up here. The staff here treated us like royalty. The location is within easy walking distance of the National Mall and a cheap cab ride back when your feet have given out. The restaurant is on the pricey side but the food was excellent. I would make the Hamilton my first choice on my next visit. 
214446097	 I booked this hotel because it was close enough to walk to the mall. It was a manageable walk. The beds in the room are really to small for two kids to share. There is no free breakfast at this hotel and the restaurant is to expensive to eat at. We found a McDonalds close by though. If I were booking for a couple's trip this hotel would be good. I might look elsewhere if I were bringing kids. 
214419117	 This hotel is very nice, updated, clean with a helpful friendly staff. The hotel restaurant has a great happy hour with really good food. You can also get breakfast and lunch there too. There is a Starbucks adjacent to the hotel. The only negative I could find is the Wifi is a little expensive and does not work very well. Overall we were very pleased with our accommodations. 
214354002	 Classic building, good position. There is a pub, a restaurant, and a Starbucks in the same building (very smart). There is also an ATM into the hall. The rooms are super clean (and extra towels are provided everyday, without request). The staff is extremely kind, smiling, and efficient (four stars for that!). Breakfast is quite far from the European standards (eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, yogurt, cereals and fruit. That's all). 
213995810	 I was very happy with The Hamilton Crowne Plaza. I stayed there for three nights during the 4th of July long weekend. I am a loyal IHG member and the hotel recognised that with a high floor room with a view, late checkout and free wifi.<br/>LOCATION<br/>The hotel is located on 14th Street which leads down to the National Mall and all the museums and monuments you could ever want. It is about 10-15 walk. Macy's is a couple of blocks away. There is a limited range of restaurants and cafés around the hotel but remember this is a national capital so the general area gets a bit quiet after working hours. The nearest subway station is McPherson Square and is only a 5 minute walk. Georgetown is the place to eat. It's just fantastic and only two metro stations away. <br/>ROOM and FACILITIES<br/>My room overlooked the park and was very nicely appointed. The bed and pillows were just wonderful! The bathroom was spacious. I really loved returning to the hotel after a long day. My bar fridge was making some loud and strange noises and the hotel was prompt in attending to it. The wifi was very good. There is a smallish fitness centre but no pool. <br/>FINALLY . . . .<br/>The park across the road is lovely but potentially problematic after nightfall due to the high number of homeless living there. The hotel dining options are limited I think. The Starbucks, while claiming to be full service, has a limited range and it's opening hours are odd. The hotel restaurant is the only other option and it seemed overly busy. Room service was prompt and tasty.<br/><br/>It's hard to know where to stay in Washington. It's good to be close to the National Mall because when you are tired you can come back for a snooze and return when you are ready. On the other hand, Georgetown seemed so lively and interesting at night I wonder if staying there is also a good option. For my part, I was very happy with the Crowne Plaza. 
235256475	 My husband &amp; I spent three nights here (he was attending a meeting; I was sightseeing). The hotel is easy to reach via the Metro (we flew into DCA and rode the Metro in) which is a block away. The location is great for exploring all the major sites of the Nation's Capitol. <br/><br/>A big downside was the slow internet service. We did sign up for the reward card in order to avoid being charged for wi-fi, but we had trouble using the Internet (including trying to reach tripadvisor).<br/><br/>The room was small but fine for our needs. 
235220714	 The hotel is well located in DC. About 15mins walk to the White House and a bit longer on to Washington Memorial and US Capital.<br/>Several small restaurants and a pharmacy are located within 1-2 blocks of this location.<br/>There is a subway station within walking distance too.<br/>The hotel has a Starbucks within it and a restaurant/bar.<br/>Rooms are compact but well kitted out and very clean.<br/>Staff are friendly and accommodating.<br/>Do not confuse this hotel with The Hamilton hotel which is located a few blocks away.<br/>Coffee machine, safe, fridge, good TV and a bath all part of the room fixtures - we had a king room. 
235088898	 First of all the Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a historic hotel. That was one reason I wanted to stay here. The lobby was pretty. The rooms had lost any historic character and looked like any other hotel room except they were smaller. They were very small. Two double beds and a small bathroom which didn't have enough counter space to hold a cosmetic bag. The bathroom looked nice but tiny. The beds were comfortable but again two double beds for two adults and 2 kids was cramped. The beds were made with giant overstuffed plush pillows that of course I wanted no where near me. That's like major germ place and of course there was no place to put them as they were huge and the room small. They can't be washed but I guess they look good. Location was good but not as good at the Willard. $45 for valet parking was a bit much but its the city. Too small for a family of 4. I will not be back. 
234294245	 This is a very convenient hotel to downtown DC, transportation, the Mall, White House and other main attractions. The building and rooms were clean and comfortable, and the service was friendly. The parking, breakfast, internet, etc. are all expensive but it is all pretty aligned with other hotels in the area. Overall, in 3 visits here, I have found it a convenient, comfortable experience with everything I need for a city stay. 
234181249	 excellent location, all major landmarks within walking distance and georgetown as well. delivers value for money. nice and clean room, wifi included yet it could be upgraded as the room coverage was far from excellent. yet, i would definitely recommend 
233466347	 Spent a weekend there with my sister, for a conference that attracted thousands to the DC area. The hotel is well situated to visit most of the main attractions in DC, while not being right in the center of the city. We walked everywhere, except when our feet hurt too much! The hotel is clean, but a little worn; not atypical of smaller city hotels. Complaints were that we were promised a high floor (and paid extra for it) but were given a low floor, which we promptly had changed. The bathroom in our room was TEENY for two people (especially two women!) to share--very little counter space in an odd-shaped bathroom. No mini-bar, but there was a fridge in the room for the free waters they provided at the front desk. We had to ask for them, but they were generous with the bags (two bottles to a bag). The service was very friendly and all in all, a good stay. No free wifi,though --really?? Paid $15/day for decent internet access. They have THREE options--this was the middle one. Come on. 
17570589	 The &quot;Crowne Plaza The Hamilton&quot; isn't the kind of hotel I usually choose for my vacations: the atmosphere is quite formal, the staff professional (but don't expect warm welcomes!).<br/>Anyway, if you stay here on the weekend, this hotel can be very cheap; at 99$ per night, booking with Venere.com, I consider it a bargain.<br/><br/>Rooms are confortable, with nice bathrooms. The A/C was quite noisy (a common feature in many hotel, unfortunately).<br/>Breakfast wasn't included, but there's a Starbuck coffee nearby.<br/>The location is very good for tourists, close to the White House.<br/><br/>All in all, a good stay, if you don't mind the formal atmosphere. 
17186061	 This “historic” hotel has a Beaux Arts entrance and an impressive lobby, but as far as I’m concerned, the grandeur stops there. When you get off the elevator, it looks like any other hotel, not the “boutique” hotel I was expecting. Front desk staff were disinterested. The elevators are tiny, and can only accommodate about four adults, and that’s without luggage. It makes for some uncomfortable moments when people try to get in on other floors. Our room was small and not as clean as I had expected. There was a blown light bulb in the bathroom. The TV was an old Zenith. We received a complimentary sleep kit with earplugs, an eye mask, and lavender spray for the bedding. Little did I know how badly I would need those earplugs! Our room was at the front of the hotel, and the street noise at 3:30 AM was unbelievable. I couldn’t bring myself to use the coffeemaker because it was placed on a shelf in the bathroom about 18 inches from the toilet, at the same level as the toilet. Housekeeping did little more than give us fresh towels. There are PCs for guest use in the business center but there is a fee. On the plus side, this hotel currently offers a weekend rate of around $100 per night. You can fly into DCA and hop on the Metro to get within one block of the hotel. They will check your luggage if you arrive early or plan to be in the area after you check out. There is a Starbucks on site, and a great on the fly breakfast / lunch place next door called The Brown Bag that is open Monday through Friday. The hotel is within walking distance of several tourist destinations, although I feel the maps give the impression that it is closer than it actually is. You might want to save your energy for all the walking you have to do at the museums and memorials. We took a cab from the hotel to the Newseum, and it cost $8.00 for two people. 
17130381	 The hotel is nice, however we had problems with 90% of the staff we came in contact with. Upon arrival we had to go inside and ask for someone to come valet our car, the front desk staff were very unfriendly the three times I was in contact with them, and then upon departure we had to wait 30 minutes for our car to be brought to us (they brought the wrong car first). However, our main complaint is with the night manager and the hotel's claim to be &quot;pet friendly&quot;. My husband and I booked this hotel because it allows pets. We had an evening event and there was a problem with my dog while we were away. The frontdesk received a complaint at 10pm from another guest that my (7lb)dog was barking. The hotel called my husbands cell at 10:15 to alert us to the problem. I was back in our hotel room by 10:25 to attend to my barking dog. I was then called by the night manager to inform me I would be charged $100 due to my pet disturbing another guest. The night manager, was very unprofessional in handling this. He would not rationally discuss the situation nor acknowledge the fact we reacted immediately (within 10 minutes) and took care of the situation. My complaint is not with the $100 it is with the way the situation was handled. Be weary of this staff.....they are not professional. 
16981858	 Wonderful two day stay at The Hamilton with my three children. Perfect location for sight seeing. Close to all major attractions and the Metro stop. Our room was very clean and modern, well appointed. Loved the gift bag and still listen to the relaxation CD at home. Beds were super comfortable and the mountain of towels was perfect for my 2 showers a day teenagers. We ate in the restaurant and while service was poor the food was delicious...warning...EXPENSIVE!<br/>Staff could not have been nicer! 
16980409	 The Hamilton claims to cater to business travelers. Unfortunately, they don't live up to those claims. I expected better service and a better experience than what I received. <br/><br/>The cons (at least the worst of them):<br/><br/>- The valets are not very helpful. In fact, when I first arrived I had to search one out to have my car parked. Not all of the staff speak English very well, which can make some things a little challenging.<br/>- There is very little space to pull off the side of the road to access the valet service (14th St is a very busy road in DC).<br/>- You have to pay to access the hotel's wifi. It doesn't make sense that budget hotels offer internet access for free while high end hotels continue to charge for it. Oh, and when you do pay for it, its terrible. <br/><br/>I checked in at 3.00, and instantly had problems (above and beyond having to go find someone to park my car), as the door lock for my room wasn't functioning correctly. The maintenance staff spent the next six hours working on the door before they finally gave up and moved me to another room. I had inquired more than once during that six hours about being moved to another room, but I never received an acceptable reason why they waited so long to move me. After they moved me, I guess they didn't pass word around the front desk, because after about 45 minutes in my new room, another guest was trying to enter the room.<br/><br/>In the morning, the manager apologized profusely for the problems I had experience, and offered to remove the parking fee from my bill. I appreciated that, but I would have rather had the problem handled properly to begin with than have to receive apologies after it was handled poorly.<br/><br/>The pros:<br/>- Great location, easy to get to, with Franklin Square across the street, a rare green space in the Distict<br/>- The management was very apologetic as I was checking out.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this hotel. I was disappointed by my experience there. 
16604798	 The Hamilton CP is a pretty nice hotel. The hotel staff were all polite and customer-focused. Our room was quiet, neat and clean. Check-in and check-out was extremely fast and easy. The location of the hotel was great - easily accessbile within walking distance to the McPherson metro stop and easy access to I-395 (it's a straight shot over the 14th street bridge.)<br/><br/>The hotel's entrance is very pretty -- it's got just the right amount of old-world style coupled with new, modern elements. The elevators are very small - they say they fit 8, but, I'd say 5 adults max and it is full.<br/><br/>Our room was well-appointed, nicely decorated, roomy and clean (although not spotless). The a/c worked like a dream inside the room - it was so welcoming after being out in the city during 90 degree weather! The bed was very comfortable; but, I think slightly more substantial or firmer pillows would have been better. (The pillows were actually quite large, but, they just didn't have enough support in them - especially if you try to sit up and read a book in bed.) The tv in the bedroom hasn't been upgraded to a flat panel yet; and, I think ours was only 19 inches.<br/><br/>The bathroom was lovely; however, I could always use more counter space; and, the toilet paper holder was in an odd spot -- underneath the sink; but that was because there was no other place to put it. There was one robe included; even though two of us were staying in the room. I'm sure I could have called the front desk to request a second one; but, why not just put two in there if the room is double-occupancy? The toiletries were pretty nice and nice-sized as well (as a matter of fact, they also included some nice lavender linen spray, earplugs, an eyemask and a soothing sleep cd.) The shower pressure and temperature controls were very good. I loved that they have that rounded shower rod that gives you more room to move around in the shower.<br/><br/>Breakfast is not included in your stay unless you are on the executive level; but I believe even that's only if you stay on a weekday. Room service stops at 11pm; so, pack your own healthy snacks, or, walk down to the McDonald's for some non-healthy ones.<br/><br/>There is no pool. However, their workout center is open 24 hours a day.<br/><br/>Like any hotel that offers valet and bellhop services, be ready to tip -- including on top of the $33/day parking fee. But, what is good about the parking is that you can check-out of the hotel, but, still keep your car parked until 5pm with no further charges. 
143487491	 I was not familiar with the area and I was concerned of the distance to the tourist sites. When we got there we were delighted! white house is 2 blocks away very easy walk. the Metro stop is one block away (McPherson) very convenient to travel around the city. I took a taxi to Union station and it was just 10 min away ($11)<br/>The restaurant is delicious and not overpriced I recommend the happy hour :) 
143485462	 My partner and I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for 5 nights in October 2012.<br/><br/>The Hamilton Crowne Plaza is overpriced, and disappointing in terms of value and quality. <br/><br/>I booked a five night stay in an Executive Room (on the 14th Floor) with full breakfast for two guests each day. Despite the fact that I was a Platinum Priority club member, there was no attempt to give me a good room. I was given a room on the 14th Floor (Executive Level) but the room was very small and looked straight on to an office building, where I could see the workers through their windows (and they can see me as well). <br/>The door of our room does not seem to close properly, there was a gap around its edges so that light from the corridor can be seen and noise from the corridor can be heard in our room. On the Saturday night, there was a lot of noise, shouting and loud conversation in the corridor on the 14th Floor at about 3 or 4 am.. causing significant disruption to our sleep.<br/><br/>The Executive room rate was supposed to include &quot;Drinks and snacks&quot; from 5-7pm on weekdays. (This was clearly stated in the information book located within the room.) When we enquired about this at the front desk, we were told that the &quot;Executive Club Room is closed for renovations, but we could have the complimentary drinks etc at the Front Bar instead...just show the bar staff our room swipe card keys&quot; <br/>However, when we later showed up at the bar on our first day, we were told 3 different stories. The concierge said that &quot;there is no such thing as complimentary drinks for Executive guests&quot;; the bar staff said &quot;Executive guests do NOT get free drinks but will only get one free appertiser if they bought some drinks at the bar&quot; and the restaurant staff said &quot;Executive Room guests do not get any complimentary stuff at all, everthing has to be paid for&quot; <br/><br/>Needless to say, we were so confused, flabbergasted and disappointed with all this that we did not bother to pursue this for the rest of our 5 day stay.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is that the hotel charges fees for internet usage at the rate of $12.95 per device per day. In this day and age, many hotels provide free wi-fi. Even despite paying top dollar for an Executive Room (and non-existent free drinks etc) it is extremely disappointing that the hotel still wants to charge more for internet access.<br/><br/>I think better service and value could be obtained elsewhere. <br/>I will definitely not be coming back to the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. 
143364208	 I booked this hotel through Priceline and was slightly concerned with a few of the previously made comments regarding the remodel. These concerns proved not to be a concern during my stay. The staff were very nice and hospitable. I arrived early in the day, much before my scheduled check in and they wee able to accommodate me and check me in early. The room as comfortable and clean. Close to metro and attractions. Would have no reservations about staying here again. 
143322178	 This is a nice hotel but we were overcharged because we asked for a club level room, and were told on our arrival that they no longer offered breakfast and drinks in the club level anymore. There was no additional offer of free breakfast or drinks in the restaurant on the ground floor either, or reduction on the rate. Also, I still find it poor that these hotel chains make patrons pay over $12 for 24h of wifi internet, when many are offering this for free. The lack of a bar fridge and additional goodies was also noticeable. The recent update to the rooms was good but the sewerage smell in the main entrance foyer on occasions was rather off putting, as was the presence of room service trays with old food for many hours in the corridors. 
143098536	 Attended meeting at convention center, walked about 5 blocks each day to meeting. Nice area. Walked few blocks to visit White House, National Mall, museums. Plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. Recent total renovation. Old hotel, so rooms are small but adequate. Staff very friendly and helpful. 
143029288	 First time to Washington and what a great city! Hotel was in an area close to everything - convention centre, Capital, White House, etc etc. very tastefully done reno of rooms and lobby. Front desk agent Veron was very helpful as was the Concierge Anna. The bed, desk, lighting and everything else in my room was perfect. Internet was 12.95 per night which seemed odd in 2012. Should be included at every hotel as far as i am concerned. Lighting in bathroom was cruumy but room wad so nice and clean that i didn't really care. Would stay here again for sure. And add Washington to your list of beautiful US cities to visit! 
115875578	 The Hamilton is an exceptional hotel, great rooms, comfortable beds, and located in the heart of town and within walking distance of most attractions. 1 block away from a metro station. Offered free breakfast and wireless Internet for Priority Club members, so well worth signing up! I would stay at this hotel again if visiting D.C.! 
115812888	 I checked in with my Wife &amp; 2 kids (11 &amp; 16) at The Hamilton on July 11, 2011 and stayed for 3 nights. The reviews were pretty good so we booked with a AAA rate. Location for downtown was good. 1 block form McPherson Metro stop which was ideal for our travels to the capitol/smithsonian, etc.<br/>Consierge &quot;Innocent&quot; was very polite as noted in other reviews, and he did a pretty good job with informing us on tours, etc. <br/>Parking for us was $33/day, ok I guess. Our last day we checked out for noon but they let us keep the car with valet so we could hit more smithsonian for only $16, which was an added bonus. Car service was pretty quick too, less than the 15-20 minutes they tell you.<br/>It's an older building rebranded for Crowne Plaza but was clean and the front desk was very quick &amp; attentive to our requests for towels, blankets and a replacement ironing board, which was a must for a family of 4 on the road.<br/>It's Downtown DC, so (as we learned) there's not much going on after business hours. There were some good restaurants but some apparently &quot;not exactly suited&quot; for families?<br/>14K restaurant had a great breakfast buffet, although around $75 for 4 of us plus tip- we had plenty of choice to eat. Made to order omlets, plenty of fresh cold fruit &amp; typical breakfast fare for the buffet- menu items optional.<br/>CVS located on 14th (24 hours) which was convenient. Typical LG flat panel with enough channels for the kids to stay happy also.<br/>Would stay again considering the Metro location.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers! 
115773969	 The Hamilton is a venerable old hotel, with a history dating back to the 19th century. That means there are some nice architectural features in the lobby, but the rooms are on the small side - which makes it more of a tourist hotel than a business hotel.<br/><br/>Positives: My room was clean and comfortable, with a good bed, a small sitting area, and a spotless bathroom. The staff were polite and helpful, and check-in was near-instant. Priority Club Rewards members get a choice of free Wi-Fi or half-price breakfast. I took the Wi-Fi and am happy to report it worked well. (But really - Wi-Fi should be free for all guests.) The hotel is a 10-minute walk to the excellent Logan Circle neighbourhood, with lots of restaurants and bars, and maybe a 15-minute walk from Dupont Circle. There's a Starbucks in the lobby, so that took care of breakfast, and I was on my way. <br/><br/>So-so. The elevators, as in many older hotels, are on the small side. No fridge in the room, which was OK for me but could be a drag for tourists. (Apparently they will supply a fridge if asked.) The vending machine had half a dozen kinds of soda, but the only way to get a bottle of water in the hotel would have been to order one from room service. And the business centre charges by the minute and 50¢ per printed page. As I said, not a great hotel for business.<br/><br/>All in all, the price was right, and I'd be happy to stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza again. 
115700329	 This is a review of my weekend stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza Hotel for a family get together/party.<br/><br/>After a short flight from JFK to Dulles, I was able to manuever the swift public transport (#5a Metro Bus to Roslynn &amp; Blue/Orange Line to McPherson Square) and arrive at the Crowne Plaza's front desk just before noon.<br/><br/>The building itself looks historic &amp; once you enter the lobby the overall feeling of stately comfort prevails. Check in was swift (I booked a King with club perks) and I was given tickets (continental breakfast &amp; drinks) with an explanation on how they should be used.<br/><br/>After a quick tutorial on key card/elevator use, I was on my way upstairs to the top floor. The room was pleasant with view towards 14th street. Bathroom was a decent size and there was enough closet space for my belongings. Yes, the coffee maker was stored on the bottom shelve in the bathroom, but since I'm not a coffee drinker, it wasn't an issue.<br/><br/>There was a complimentary robe hanging behind the bathroom door &amp; a small packet of lavender mist to relax &amp; freshen the room if you needed it. A large flatscreen TV sat on the desk &amp; I stored my clothes in the small dresser beneath.<br/><br/>AC worked fine, &amp; the bedding was good. Other than killing a small spider the second night I would say I slept well. Housekeeping was great &amp; they did a good job with cleaning every day. Sadly the club lounge on the 12th floor was closed, (summer hours) so I went downstairs to use the perks. The lounge was nice, plush chairs &amp; a large flat screen tv. Downstairs bar was nice, bartender was cool &amp; mixed good drinks.<br/><br/>Breakfast was the best part. I was happy with just the continental, (no need to upgrade). Cereal, juice, fresh fruit, yogart, bagels, toast, creme cheese, jelly, tea or coffee, the choices were adequate. For $7.00 I could have had Frensh Toast, Eggs, or other hot foods. Some in my group weren't impressed with the hot food, &amp; instead chose starbucks the next day (with an entryway in the lobby). Hey, I liked having this perk included &amp; fuel was just right for hot summer day.<br/><br/>The conference/party room was nice. Located on the lower level, the family was able to have a good party &amp; never felt boxed in. Buffet style set up outside &amp; you carried the food in, the staff was okay, but could have picked up the empty plates a tad quicker. The restrooms on this level were clean &amp; the staff was very friendly. Elevator service was okay, but really small, &amp; you sometimes had to wait for another one. This only really became an issue on Sunday when multiple parties were checking out &amp; with luggage it was tricky, so some just rode up to ride down &amp; it worked out.<br/><br/>Conveniant location, close to CVS, &amp; McPherson Square subway/metro. Valet parking was good, you just had to remember to call in advance. Overall I'd have to say I enjoyed my stay at the this hotel. 
115634748	 On the Amtrak website I clicked on &quot;Need a hotel?&quot; and you were the best deal. We were going to DC for our son's Parents' Weekend at GW and chose the Hamilton Crowne because it was close to GW and a good price. We had no idea that it is also a lovely old and beautifully restored gem of a hotel. The concierge, Innocent Chesang, was great. It is a walk from everywhere you want to be in DC. The breakfast buffet is excellent and half-price for those staying at the hotel. We recommend this hotel now to all of our friends and fellow GW parents traveling to Washington DC. A real find. From Kathleen Edwards, Boston 
115586969	 Fantastic stay and friendly staff- rooms are small but cozy and comfortable. Really enjoyed being in the heart of DC and getting a great feel for the city. Restaurant was great too! Nice to have out door street seating. 
28613490	 The pricing of the rooms vary wildly. I got a room that barely fit the bed and was charged $450 for the night. The A/C and temp control didn't work, I was never told I could receive a continental breakfast and then when I found where it was being served (after asking), couldn't get there on the elevator. Finally called and was told to use my room card. That could have been done at the very beginning. The bed was very comfortable. Old style TV. The business center is an absolute joke. Get into the 21st century, please. Oh, and daily rate for Internet service. Ouch. 
28591051	 April 17-22, 2009. Room 1232. Having read several reviews stating the rooms were small and the service was lacking, I must say that I loved this hotel and the service and staff were absolutely top notch. Every single staff member was exceptional, helpful, attentive and courteous. <br/>Nice location (one block from the metro and 4 blocks from the White House), makes the hotel convenient for sightseeing and walking distance to several fine restaurants, the White House, and most Smithsonian Museums (15-20 minutes one way). But any hotel in this area are very expensive. Book early and keep your eye on the rates. A rare bargain (like I got) can still be had! 
28357851	 We stayed here for a friend's wedding. Due to priority points we were upgraded to a junior suite. The suite was nice, had all amenities we needed. There was a very unattractive spot on the carpet close inside the entrance of the room, not sure what it was. The bed was very comfy, with nice, clean blankets and lots of pillows. Room was very quiet, and we were unable to hear any outside/traffic noise. Service at the desk was so-so, but that may just be the big city attitude, not sure. Took about 20 minutes for valet to retrieve our car when we checked out, while waiting on the sidewalk. Felt like this was a little long. Overall, we would stay here again. 
28001572	 My fiance and I stayed at the hotel the weekend of March 27th for 3 days, along with our baby.<br/>The hotel was very accomodating, and upon request upgaded us to an executive king suite at no extra charge (although I am a platinum rewards member, may have helped). Also provided a crib no extra charge.<br/>The room was a decent size, and was impressed that the AC was not your typical noisy aC that keeps you up and night. Very quiet, almost like propper central AC.<br/><br/>The concierge was very helpful, reccomended an excellent cuban restaurant (LIMA), close to the hotel, and then proceeded to get us in w/ no wait even though there was initially a 45 min wait.<br/><br/>The staff was very friendly and courteous, morning breakfast buffets were pretty good, and the bar has a decent ambience and though we only had appetizers the night we got there, they were very, very, good.<br/><br/>Very solid hotel choice, and if you are a platinum rewards member for ICH points, they really go out of their way to accomodate.<br/><br/>Would definately consider staying there again next we visist the DC area. 
27666646	 My DH and I stayed here for 2 nights. The room was small and there is a park across the street which had people fighting all ngiht long. We heard sirens and fir engines all night long. The one positive thing about this hotel was its location. We walked all over and were ablt to walk to everything igf you are in good shape. e walked to Chinatown, Linciln memorial, Smithsion Museums and even to Arlington Cemetery. 
27312712	 I loved being able to get around so easily; I walked everywhere. The lobby is small, the starbucks can get crowded but the restaurant didn't seem to bust from the seams in the 3 days I spent here. If you're looking for cozy nooks or generous common areas, this isn't going to be a great choice. <br/><br/>I was after location, convenience and a fair price which the Hamilton supplied. The room felt narrow, as did the hallways and the lobby, but if you're just there to get good rest, it's more than fine. The Metro station is very close by also. 
203377877	 Visited Washington to see all the sights and based on the good rating and reviews we choose this Crowne Plaza. We arrived by car on a rainy night and had to stand in the rain together with the bellboy to unload the car. As a platinum member I did expect a upgrade - but told it was not possible because the hotel was full :-( not acceptable. The standard room was nice and comfy with a small bath room - acceptable and clean. The lobby always very busy. Suggest to find Bfast outside to awoid the poor selection in the lounge and pricy restaurant. Starbucks in the lobby a good thing. A good hotel - with the prices it is expected to be great. 
203366893	 Beautiful hotel that is about 1 block from the Metro. Flew into DCA and took the Metro to the hotel. Staff is very friendly and helpful. We did have problems with the elevators and the hotel did make a good effort to try and fix the problem quickly but it is an old hotel. The sheets on the bed are nice but the blanket was thin for my taste. I should have asked for an extra blanket. 
203365947	 My boyfriend and I just returned home after a four night stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in DC. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at the hotel. The lobby was charming, the staff was friendly, and our room was clean and had a huge, comfortable bed. To point out a couple negatives and reasons why I did not give a 5-star rating...1) our room had a funky smell and 2) there is very little counterspace in the bathroom. We also noticed a lot of outside noise on Friday night and Saturday night as we were on the fourth floor and our room faced a popular night club. However, we didn't mind too much as we live in a city and are quite used to it.<br/><br/>We really appreciated the hotel restaurant's happy hour, which offered beer, wine, and other liquor for $5.25 everyday from 4 to 9; we needed this after walking for several hours each day!<br/><br/>What we enjoyed most was the location of the hotel. The White House was only a few blocks away and all the other monuments and government buildings could be reached within a 20 minute walk. The weather was perfect and we were able to walk the 2 miles or so from one end of the National Mall (Lincoln Memorial) to the other end (Capitol) with no problems. We were surrounded by walking tours, bike tours, and other groups/families using the city's public bike system, Capital Bikeshare, to get around the Mall, so if walking isn't for you, there are plenty of other options.<br/><br/>Two metro stops were also in very close proximity to the hotel: McPherson Square (orange and blue lines) and Farragut North (red line). 
203319936	 I travel all over the world and this was one of the worst experiences I've had. It was Nike Half-Marathon weekend and they were not ready for it. We are local but stayed in city with our kids who were running. On arrival, had reservations for two rooms... one not ready for nearly 2 hours from their check-in time (Their excuse: &quot;We're very busy&quot;); Had reservation for MONTHS prepaid for one King with a view, got one with a building wall (Excuse: &quot;We are sold out&quot;); Reservation was for rooms on same floor... nope, 12th and 5th. Elevators for Friday and Saturday either did not stop on some floors either up or down or stopped on every floor below 5. (They did not think to get off their rears and actually ride them to understand the problem... just would incredulously ask, &quot;They aren't working?... but they ARE running!&quot;); Rooms were short on towels and amenities... had to call... most lines never answered and had to go through Front Desk for all: Front desk folks were clearly over-matched, Manager not engaged. Bright spot was the Concierge was personable and helpful... and they have a S'Bucks!! Finally, after a long discussion with Manager was awarded some extra IHG points for the thrash. We would have moved if the town wasn't pretty much sold out. Won't stay here again... they should be embarrassed!! 
203244596	 Currently staying at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza, great location if you're looking for a reasonable hotel within walking distance of most of the tourist attractions in DC. Our only complaint with the Hamilton is the poor advice given by the concierge. We asked about going to Arlington Nat'l Cemetery, how to get there and was there public transportation within the Cemetery. We were told tourists were not allowed to just wander around the cemetery and must take an outside tour. He also told us the DC night tour we already booked was not a good tour and there would be no stopping for photos. He then told us he could book trips for both tours for us. Sadly, he was misinformed on both trips. We took the Metro to Arlington and took a fantastic hop on hop off tour inside the cemetery, seeing everything we wanted at the pace we wanted to go. The night tour we booked through Old Towne Trolly was also really well done and we made several stops. Concierge' should be well informed on all tours in their city, not just the ones they want to make money on. 
203241846	 This hotel is very clean and well cared for. All of the staff are polite, very helpful, and do everything to make sure you have a wonderful stay. They always smile and greet everyone.<br/><br/>I am handicap and require a wheelchair 24/7. While all rooms are beautiful and well appointed, they have very few handicap accessible rooms. They had to move us 3 times before they located a room with a roll-in shower. But even then I still needed a shower chair for me to use the shower. The handicap usable sink wasn't low enough to use from the wheelchair. My chin rested on the sink's counter making the sink almost impossible to use. Every room, handicap accessible or not, had narrow doorways and the beds required steps to get into. Since I can not stand or walk I had to be lifted into and off of the beds. They have 5 elevators to serve those staying at the hotel, but each held only 4 people (or 3 people and 1 wheelchair). The hotel has 14 floors and the elevators worked only occasionaly. There are stairs, but they don't work for wheelchairs and luggage. When we did use the elevator it would stop at every floor, often not opening on the floor we selected. Two times the elevator going to the lobby would stop at ever floor but then not open at the lobby. So we had to ride it, stopping at each floor, up to the top floor and back down to the lobby a second time before it stopped and the doors opened to the lobby. The morning we checked out and had to be in the lobby by 6:50am for our shuttle to the airport, the elevators stopped working. It took 2 men to get an elevator to our floor and get us to the lobby. That process took 20+ minutes and made us late for the shuttle. Luckily there were streets closed for a run/race that morning and the shuttle was late, making us on time. The hotel had just changed all TV's to HD, and the one in our room would hold a signal for 2 to 3 minutes and then go dark. The 5th time we called for service they put in a new TV. The new TV worked one evening and then it didn't have sound or picture the next morning. Fortunatly that was the morning we were leaving, so we didn't bother to tell them, again, about the TV. The hotel did apologize for the first 3 non-handicap rooms, the high beds and sink, the awful TV reception, and especially the elevators, and to make things a bit better they refunded us for a $85 dinner charge and $35 breakfast charge. We thought that was very nice and we thanked them a number of times. The hotel is just a block from the Metro and the hotel employees were wonderful suggesting what times were best for seeing everything and which restaurants were great with decent prices. The hotel bar and restaurant were excellent (Wonderful lamb chops and great wine list), but quite expensive with everything ala carte. No pool, but they had a great work-out room. I should also mention that there is a Starbucks coffee house in the hotel lobby. We went to DC on a Delta vacation, which included the hotel for 6 nights, r/t air from our home in Michigan, trip insurance, and limo transfers to hotel from airport and then hotel to airport. Skycaps at Reagan airport were excellent! The area where the hotel is used to have many, many hookers and drug dealers, but ii is now a lovely area with a park and family areas.. There are also numerous first class restaurants within a block or 2. If you do NOT need a handicap accessible room and are able to walk up and down hills and stairs unassisted, the Hamilton Crown Plaza is a perfect place to stay in Washington DC. If you use a wheelchair I suggest you call the hotel yourself to be sure the hotel understands, and confirm exactly what you need and expect to make your room and stay comfortable.. 
115416007	 Stayed here on a family trip to DC and were v disappointed. We had a two double bedded room for us and two kids and it was way too small. Shabby dark room... Bathroom had a badly cracked sink and we found hairs around the bathroom too. The lampshades weren't burnt from too hot lamps so scruffy. On the second night the cleaner had bizarrely removed and not replaced the shower curtain... A confused reception just apologized but were equally confused!<br/>Only one good thing was value of breakfast buffet which is well priced. 
115301584	 Hotel shows it's age and a little wear but in a good, refined way. Room was small in comparison to some but nicely decorated, very clean and updated. Nice closet space cmpared to most. Hotel was very crowded but the floors were relatively quiet at night and even during the daytime. Location is central to convention center and several good local places to eat (I recommend Thai Tanic) and safe to walk at night. The hotel restaurant, 14k, has a good menu and wonderful patio seating for people watching. Make sure to ask your waiter for the &quot;Bar Bites&quot; and Dessert menus though, or you might not see them. If you get the chance to try to the Lobster Bisque or pretzel bread, go for it! Absolutely wonderful!<br/><br/>What made this hotel very special to us and ensured our return was the staff, starting with the Guest Services Coordinator Innocent Chesang (yes that's his name :) He was outstanding! The man knows everything there is to know about DC including where to purchase the best cigars!! Stay at this hotel for no other reason than Innocent; he takes away all anxiety of navigating the city. Another member of the staff was a wait staff person named Marybel; another treasure. She kept us entertained with her wonderful way with the patrons and the service was impeccable. Unfortunately I can't remember the name of the young man who checked us in, and also engaged us in conversation about the food show we were attending; very pleasant and he too went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. If I had to say anything bad about the hotel it would be that the elevators (there are several and not much of a wait ever) are very small. We travel alot with business and if that's the worst I can come up with then it's a WINNER!! 
115210838	 We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. Conveniently located in the vicinity of the White House (7 minutes walk) and the National Mall, this hotel is recently restored and provides state of the art in-room facilities. Internet TV with a huge selection of TV channels, big bathroom, excellent bed, though not very comfortable pillows.<br/><br/>While I was a Planitinium member of the Priority Club and was given a free upgrade upon check-in, I was also given the choice of free internet in the room or half paid breakfast. I took the choice of breakfast, which proved the wrong one !<br/>Breakfast was expensive and had 3 choices : omelette or jam or a good variety of fruits.... no cheese, no ham, Plus that if you took omelette instead of jam, you paid extra as you have eaten warm breakfast ! It pissed me off.<br/><br/>And guys, internet in the room not free ??? I mean common, we are in the 21st century, internet should not be an option anymore, it should be included complimentary in the price.<br/><br/>Overall I would return, but not eat breakfast, choose the free internet instead. 
115167128	 When we checked in we found a half drank bottle of water and a pair of socks left on the floor. We also thought the room had a refridgerator. When we told the front desk they apologized sent up a fridge and paid for our wi-fi for the duration of our stay. Very nice place and close to the metro. 
115069430	 Beautiful hotel, wonderful room, very helpful and friendly staff, and great location! What more could you want?! 
114814762	 We recenty stayed at Hamilton Crowne Plaza and really enjoyed our stay. We checked in well after midnight but called ahead to let the staff know we would be late and they were very accommodating. Clean rooms, great views, great location. Our room (Single King) was slightly cramped especially in the bathroom but overall very nice and well decorated. Some friends of ours also stayed in the hotel and had some problems with their air conditioner but were promptly switched to a different room, given a discounted rate, and given complimentary breakfast at the hotel restaurant with no questions asked. Concierge was very friendly and helpful and had great advice (be sure to ask for Innocent- he was great!). Overall excellent and relaxing stay. 
168729858	 A friend and I met in DC for the Fourth of July holiday. The Hamilton Crowne Plaza was our home base. It is a beautiful, historic property where attention to detail has not gone unappreciated. Conveniently located a block from a Metro station and in a lovely part of downtown, we could not have picked a better place for our needs. All of the amenities in the room were lovely, but our favorite was the Keurig coffee maker; it was a pleasant change from the usual hotel room coffee makers which make awful coffee and are a pain to use. Can't wait to return to DC and the Hamilton Crowne Plaza! 
168248554	 You really can't go wrong staying here. The location is perfect and you can easily walk to mostatattractions in the area. The rooms are recently renovated and very comfortable. We wished we had a little more downtime so we could have enjoyed the room more. The only downside is that it is fairly pricy but I think it's not overpriced considering the location. 
168239281	 In DC. for 6 nights to attend Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. 51st Convention, and chose this hotel due to its location (5 blocks) from the Convention Center, and because I'm a Priority Member.<br/>THE BEGINNING: I should have known something wasn't right and they probably had overbooked the hotel when Nikki from reservations called my home in Atlanta asking my husband if I was going to check-in that day. He got upset because he was worried about my whereabouts, and why hadn't I checked in. I had to remind him that I was staying the first night at Marriott Courtyard Convention Center with friends. I got upset because it was only 11:30 when she finally called me asking the same question. Huh? I asked her, &quot;Isn't check-in at 3:00?&quot; &quot;Then, why are you worrying my husband?&quot;<br/><br/>ROUGH PART: Upon checking in with reservations for a two double beds, the desk assistant told me that they had &quot;upgraded&quot; me to the Executive Floor with a King bed and sofa bed. I looked at him as if one of us has lost our minds! We went back and forth with the &quot;searching&quot; tomfoolery, but he just couldn't find a two beds. So, I accepted the King because it had been a very long day and I decided that I'd take the sofa and give my roommate the bed. When I finally was taken to the room, my view was of an office building next door staring me in the face and blocking the sunlight with no view of any human beings moving! I refused that room too. Then, the attendant offered me a king with a rollaway bed! &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;, was my response. My portion for the 6 nights alone was $901.00, and he expected one of us to sleep on a rollaway bed!! I told him that I be darn if we're going to pay $1800 for a week with a rollaway bed. Finally, he decided that he'd &quot;sweetened&quot; the deal by offering us breakfast! Really?<br/><br/>Miraculously, Joseph, the manager found a double/double with a view, but it reeked of a musty odor. When I complained, the very helpful and nice head of housekeeping on that floor, Ms. Deborah came in to help. She first gave me Febreeze, I sprayed with my own spray, and a maintenance worker changed the air filter and realized the carpeting was wet under the air conditioner. I told her that I was frustrated, tired, angry that this was happening to me especially since I had made my reservations back in October. The next thing I knew I had tears rolling down my face because I'd had ENOUGH, and couldn't imagine myself in this stinky room for 6 nights with the EXPENSIVE final hotel cost!<br/><br/>THE FANTASTIC: Ms. Deborah went somewhere and called &quot;someone&quot;, either the head boss of the hotel or the Real Boss of us all, God. Whomever she called, things started happening!! Ricardo came into the musty room with a key to move me AGAIN! This time to Room 311, close to elevator and larger, but with an obstructed view (which I didn't mind). It was clean, spacious, and offered some sunlight and some sense of human activity! I took it without hesitation; and my roommate who arrived later was also pleased. The only thing I wished it had was a microwave to heat up leftovers and to make instant oatmeal in the mornings before heading out for a busy day.<br/>Because of all of these &quot;moving&quot; games, I missed the first activity on the Mall that welcomed my sorority sisters and me to Washington, DC. By the time I finally got settled, the program was over! I'd missed Brandy and Dougie Fresh. :-( <br/><br/>EXTRAS: Bed was comfortable, bathroom was spacious with spa toiletries, restaurant served an awesome $14 hamburger, and cold $7 half glass of wine. Housekeeper for Room 311 and Ms. Deborah, the supervisor, were very friendly and did not rush us to get out of the room in the mornings.<br/><br/>NIGHT LIFE: There is a bar in the hotel and a couple of clubs next door, and several bars and bars in the area! <br/><br/>Getting around the city was effortless from this hotel as the Circulator Bus travels all around until 10:00 PM for $1.00 per trip and $0.50 for seniors! We just had to visit Ben's Chili Bowl which was a few blocks from the hotel, and was convenient via public transportation. A 24 hour CVS is located across the street from this hotel to get snacks and water for your room to avoid paying $5 for the Fuji bottled water provided in the room.<br/><br/>Some people on Trip Advisor complained of the homeless people in the park across the street and the constant blaring of Emergency vehicles, but neither bothered me because I didn't use the park, and the EMT were saving lives.<br/>There is no pool at this hotel.<br/><br/>I do recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Washington, DC! 
168183155	 We recently stayed here for three nights in an extremely comfortable and quiet room. Within walking distance to the White House and other attractions. Really enjoyed the Happy Hour (which ran from 4pm to 8pm daily) in the attached bar and restaurant. Most pleasant with outdoor dining facility. The happy hour food was fantastic, and excellent value for money - a great way to dine. Complimentary printing of boarding passes very easy, but free wifi was not provided as in most hotels, and was quite expensive. 
168171641	 I stayed at the Hamilton recently in town for work and it was lovely. It seems to have been recently redecorated, modern but classic. It's comfortable and clean. Room service was good, bed was comfy -- I really enjoyed my stay. It's super close to the metro and excellent dining choices. The ONLY small thing is that they have itty bitty elevators. There are 4 of them, but I'm not sure they are all running b/c there is often quite a wait for the elevator and when it does stop it tends to be full. Maybe they were busier than usual, not sure. I wasn't in a hurry most day so it was fine. <br/><br/>The room has excellent amenities. They even have an aromatherapy packet when you arrive to help you relax - lotion, room spray, leg/foot gel. It was heaven! 
168088726	 My friend and I stayed here during the summer of 2013 and we absolutely LOVED the location. It is located across from Franklin Square, which has all kinds of restaurants, stores, etc. in walking distance as well as a Metro stop -- all kinds of public transportation within immediate reach in fact. It is also a walkable distance from the monuments on the National Mall and the downtown convention center. Staff were courteous and solicitous, but be prepared for the small room, which I think is the norm in a big, busy city like Washington, DC anyway. My friend and I stayed in a queen room with a pull-out bed, which was fine, but there was a huge coffee table that took up most of the walking room when the pull-out bed was open. Also, my main gripe with the amenities: there is a charge for wi-fi use, which I think is absurd considering that all smartphones these days really rely on wi-fi for optimum use, and who wants to pay for wi-fi when you can walk into a coffee shop or fast food restaurant and it's free? 
12401253	 The good news - great location for seeing the sites, nicely decorated, nice amenities, attentive staff, surprisingly good on site restaurant called 14K, many other good restaurants within walking distance<br/><br/>The not so good news - located right across a park filled with homeless people. I never felt unsafe, but we did have some unpleasant encounters while walking to dinner and the sites. Our upgraded executive size room with two double beds was a surprisingly tight fit. We had two adults, two teenage girls and a fair amount of luggage. I imagine that the regular rooms must be quite small.<br/><br/>Street noise was not a problem for us, but it is definitely in a busy traffic area. Our bargain holiday room rate did not include an expensive valet parking fee (like most DC hotels) and a daily wifi charge. <br/><br/>There are plenty of nice DC hotels. I'll probably try a different one next time we go to Washington. 
12324429	 We stayed here in mid-November for the MLS soccer championship game because we found a great flight/hotel package discount. After reading other reviews here, I was a little bit skeptical, but we had a very enjoyable visit. <br/><br/>The lobby is beatiful and the rooms are lovely, although a little on the small side. Not so small as to feel claustrophobic, though. We were on the 7th floor and didn't have problems with street noise, although it was a little awkward that our window faced directly into the office building across the alley. Had it been a weekday we probably would have felt like we needed to keep the drapes closed. <br/><br/>The McPherson Metro station is a short walk away and even late in the evening we didn't feel uncomfortable walking to and from. <br/><br/>The only real downside we had was with dining. Most hotel restaurants are overpriced, but this one even more so. We got in late on a Friday night and would have liked to have had a light dinner, but not at $16 for a sandwich + a gratuity/service charge AND an additional delivery charge. We made do with a couple of PowerBars and some bottled drinks we had in our carry-on that night. Also, since the hotel is in the downtown/business district there aren't many other options open on weekends. We took the Metro to Chinatown one night and visited friends<br/>in Pentagon City another night and had dinner there. <br/><br/>There is a Starbucks in the lobby but both times we tried to go there,<br/>the line was out the door and we went looking elsewhere. We did find a<br/>couple of bagel/coffee places in the mornings within a short walk-- Cosi and Au Bon Pain both open on weekends. <br/><br/>Overall a nice getaway and a good location, particularly if you have business downtown. We would probably book here again. 
11545645	 I would not recomend The Hamilton Crowne Plaza in Washington D.C. because the street noise is very loud. I asked for a quiet room because the street noise could be heard from the lobby. I was given a Park room on the 10th floor but the street noise kept me awake. The next night, the unsympathetic woman at the front desk moved me to &quot;a quieter&quot; side of the 10th floor but it was still too noisy to sleep. The hotel provides ear plugs which should have been a clue. When I checked out a day early to move to a hotel with sound proofing, the woman at the front desk told me that city noise was part of staying at a city hotel. I told her I travelled all the time to big cities but had never stayed in a hotel that had so much outside noise. 
11514699	 Nice Place. Kind of boutiqueish feeling in a way. The room service seemed kind of pricey wound up payin 28$ for breakfast one morning. I think this is probably due to the 10% food tax that gets tacked on in DC though. The upgraded me from a King room to a suite possibly due to being platinum with Priority Club but not sure on that. Didn't really notice issue some person said with sirens. I was on the 14th floor. Elevators are kind of slow but I guess it's part of the decor/feel. Metro is only a block away. Fairly close to White House and some good restaurants. 
10939483	 Located at 14th and K Streets, this hotel is ideally situated for tourists -- just up from the White House and near the McPherson Square Metro stop . We found that we could walk nearly everywhere that we wanted to visit during our 4-night stay. Our room had two double beds and was quite spacious, especially for the price, as was our nicely appointed and well supplied bathroom. Decor was attractive and tasteful, though not lavish, and both the bedroom and the bathroom were clean throughout. Four pillows on each bed insured that at least one would be 'right', and the mattresses were supportive and comfortable. A welcome packet included sleep aids to counter any noise, as well as lavender spray to scent bedding. Soundproofing was lacking, so light sleepers might really appreciate those amenities. Our room was on the 10th floor and not facing the streets, so there was little noise from traffic, sirens, etc.; it might be wise to forego the view and opt for such an interior room. The hotel's restaurant has very good food that is moderately priced for Washington. While no one would mistake The Hamilton for The Sofitel, we would be happy to stay there again. Can't beat the value for the price! 
10846941	 I just spent two nights at the Hamilton on business. This hotel is exactly what it claims to be a, a restored classic. Yes the elevators are slow, and the rooms are small, but the staff is professional and courteous, the rooms are well appointed and it is in a great location. A few things I didn’t like – the view out of my room was of an office building about 20 feet away (a little weird seeing people working that close to your room), showers both mornings at 7:00 with only warm water (it was very hot at all other times), and the wireless<br/>internet connection is $9.95 per 24-hour period, but you don’t charge it to your room, it goes on a credit card (makes it a pain for travel claims). ome other reviewers mentioned the traffic/street noise, but I didn’t notice it much after rush hour. The hotel is in a great location a block away from the McPherson Square Metro station, and there are numerous restaurants ranging from inexpensive to very expensive within walking distance. I would stay here again for business or with my wife. Rooms may be a tad small for any more than two people. 
224835330	 I want to start out by saying we did enjoy our time here. This hotel is in a great location and within walking distance to the White House and other attractions, as well as restaurants and the blue line. However there were a few problems.<br/><br/>1. We were told that if we filled out the form for their frequent visitors program we would get free wifi. We filled out the form and after repeated attempts, as well as a phone call for help, we gave up because we could never manage to connect.<br/><br/>2. We were told on booking that our room would have a king bed and sofabed for our daughter. There was no sofabed and the sofa that was there was insufficient for sleeping. This would have been a serious problem had my daughter not lived in DC. She ended up going back home in the evenings after sightseeing with us all day but I would have rather that she stay with us to maximize our time together during our visit. I would have asked for a roll away bed but the room was far too small to accommodate that.<br/><br/>3. We were also charged for 3 days of valet parking, which is $45 a day. We had a car but parked it at our daughters apartment to avoid those charges, which we made all too clear on arrival. They removed the charges when this was pointed out. In addition, our bar bill was incorrect by a $100 or so, I did not keep my receipts so I could not depute those charges. As often as we travel I had not run into having to go over my bill with a fine tooth comb before. I will not be so naïve next time.<br/><br/>4. We had the breakfast buffet which consisted of scrambled eggs, I think powdered, bacon, sausage, grits, cereals, yogurt, typical fare but limited. We were shocked to find our bill, with tip was $60. I didn't ask the price because I expected it to be around $15 or so based on my own experience traveling and on the buffet itself, clearly my fault. I realize this is DC but that was, in my opinion, ridiculous for a mediocre breakfast. There is a creparie across the street that is supposedly good and The Corner Bakery Café is a couple blocks away and its good.<br/><br/>5. If having cocktails in the bar, the restroom is down a flight of stairs and down the hall in the conference area. Not very convenient. <br/><br/>6. On the day we were leaving, my daughter brought our car and we asked to valet for an hour to grab some breakfast before leaving town. When we got back, the car was in the same place we left it and they charged us $18 for less than an hour. Again, I know this is DC, but this is not my first rodeo. Given the issues that we had already had, I think it would have been a gracious, easy and inexpensive (for them) gesture to allow that hour at no charge as an act of good faith to secure our business in the future. Especially in light of the fact we parked it there and no valet had even touched the car. It would have gone a long way with me because I know at what a premium parking is in DC. Being nickeled and dimed in this manner was kind of a turn off. I want to say again, we are experienced travelers that don't mind spending money, whatever the cost, for the right experience but this felt borderline tacky.<br/><br/>On the plus side, Azeb in the bar was fantastic, probably the best service we had anywhere while there. The hotel is beautiful and the rooms, although ours was very small was clean and nicely appointed.<br/><br/>Would we stay there again? Probably not, I was very happy that we stayed on a discounted rate. Had we stayed here at the normal rates I would be far more disappointed. <br/><br/>Just a tip, if you drive in, I would research to find a public parking garage that is reasonable for tourists and take public transportation. I have since been told there are several. Get your metro cards at the nearest CVS, if you wait to get them at a metro station you will get the paper type that tourists normally get and the metro rides are far more expensive which, if nothing else, you will have to reload them often which is inconvenient. Driving here is a nightmare and time consuming. If you want to use cabs, download the Lyft app to your smart phone. The drivers are rigorously checked out and are normally young professionals who are just justifying having a car in the city. Their cars are expected to be no earlier than a 2005 model and are impeccably clean. We even got a ride in a brand new Tesla which was very cool. The drivers are very nice and polite which if you have had any experience with DC taxi cab drivers you would know is rare. In addition, you rate them after each ride and they you so it promotes respectful behavior on both sides. They are also much much more inexpensive than a regular taxi and a FAR better experience. Don't forget to fist bump your driver when you get in as there is a whole Lyft culture that expects it. Also, they are never more than 10 minutes away. Uber is another option as well.<br/><br/>All in all we had a good time there and again, the location of the hotel is excellent but I would probably stay somewhere else with comparable prices in the same area and there are many. 
224664267	 Stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for 2 nights a couple weeks ago when I was in town for a job interview. Could not have been taken care of any better!<br/><br/>I had originally booked a standard Queen room on points and found out upon arrival that I had been upgraded to a King room on the Executive top floor. The room was very well-appointed, the bathroom large and very inviting, and the bed super comfortable. <br/><br/>The only downside was that the room seemed be situated right below an A/C unit or generator on the roof and, as a result, the room was filled with an unpleasant, low-pitched droning sound. My flight had gotten in late, and my interview was the next morning, so I was really hoping to get some quality sleep the night before, but unfortunately the noise coupled with slight jet lag prevented that. I considered asking for a room change, but it was very late and I was too tired to move to another room.<br/><br/>I mentioned my troubles to Taraji(?) at the front desk the next day, and she quickly apologized and asked it would be all right to move me to a junior suite a few floors down. Needless to say, I quickly accepted! The suite was spacious and quiet, and I didn't mind at all that that it faced another building. For those looking for complete privacy, I did find that the blinds by the desk did not closed all the way (approx. 3/4), but closing the curtains quickly solved this problem. <br/><br/>The hotel also came through when I requested a late check-out. I had some early afternoon appointments and my flight out of DCA didn't leave till 5, so I was hoping for a 3pm check-out. I learned that 2pm is the standard late check-out for IHG members (signing up is free!), and I was initially told over the phone that they could not accommodate a later check-out. I was fine with that, but thought I would check with the front desk one more time on my out, just in case. Petra(?) was very kind and moved some things around so that I could have my 3pm check-out after all! <br/><br/>Checking out was a breeze (bill slipped under my door the night before) and there were no stray charges to my credit card afterward, which can sometimes happen unfortunately. <br/><br/>I didn't eat at 14K, the hotel's bar and restaurant, during this stay, though I have been in the past for happy hour, which was very good. The Starbucks on the main floor was a life-saver for quick and easy breakfast. The internet connection was strong throughout my stay. Printing was available on the ground floor. <br/><br/>Overall, a great stay, with a couple bumps which were handled very well. Would not hesitate to stay here again! 
223898977	 My wife and I decided for our 6th year anniversary we would take a trip to our national Capitol to view the sites we always see on television. Our choice for the Hamilton was the best choice we could've made as our trip was wonderful and return worthy! We arrived and were greeted by the valet service out front. Our car was easily accessible during our stay. Although we could've parked it ourselves we said why not take advantage of the services the hotel offers. Every single member of the front desk to the valet to the restaurant personnel was as friendly and courteous as ever. We needed some information for our visit of attractions and the concierge desk recommended a double decker bus tour of the city which we can hop on and hop off throughout the day. It was a wonderful suggestion and we appreciated the insight the hotel provided. Our room was on the 10th floor with the park view. Although the park consisted a lot of homeless people, we only saw them in the morning when we went down for the included breakfast buffet. From our room we had a partial view of the Washington memorial and the skyline of the DC area was very romantic. We have stayed in many hotels in other areas with similar pitches of closeness, but the proximity of the attractions to this hotel was only a 2 block walk from the White House and many other attractions. This was a wonderful trip and we plan on visiting here every year as the wealth of information in the DC area is overwhelming. 
223860610	 Last weekend was my second stay at this hotel. I did not think it could get any better, but it did. Their customer service is amazing. Their rooms are spectacular. I look forward to staying here again sometime soon. Thank you for a great, relaxing weekend. 
222912691	 I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Hamilton Crown Plaza Hotel, and was very impressed! Not the hotel I would have chosen first, but from now on it is! The location is perfect, just a couple of blocks from the White House, adjacent to Franklin Square, at 14th and K Streets, with everything necessary very close by. The hotel itself is a throwback to days gone by, elegant marble floors, ornate wall treatments, and fine, if somewhat dated, furnishings. Oh, and there's a Starbucks in the lobby, along with complimentary buffet at breakfast, and at the cocktail hour, right outside your suite! An hotel with true character! The staff was wonderful, from check-in, the door-men line up to help you in and out, and if you're a smoker like me, up and out at all hours, they really earned their keep! Management truly was &quot;one up&quot; on every other hotel in town; for example: I had an appointment with my Congresswoman at 3:00 PM, and discovered my room had no water at noon. I called the front desk, and was told there was a problem with the hot water heater, and it might not be repaired in time for my appointment. I thoroughly expressed my disappointment, and explained why, and within minutes, the Assistant Manager came to my door, and personally carried my toiletries and suit to another suite so I could shower and make my appointment at the Capital!! From the maids to the Concierge, the wait staff in the lobby bar, and the Front Desk, every employee I met was motivated to make my week comfortable, and smooth! This is one of those grand old hotels that has been partially renovated and updated, so if you're looking for the Hyatt Grand Lobby experience, this isn't it, but if you want a first class hotel with a lot of style, welcoming staff, and a great location-I happily endorse the Hamilton Crown Plaza! My new home in Washington, D.C.! 
222771394	 Hotel was very nice and had great décor. Had a great location to many attractions. Hotel was clean and staff was friendly and helpful (only one staff person I thought was not as friendly) . Room was nice and clean. Beds were comfortable. Would stay here again and will recommend to others. Only thing that I would have to say wasn't great would be the parking price, $45 a night. 
202686889	 I was in the hotel for four nights. Check in was quick, great downtown location and nice room overlooking the park. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the elevators were a real mess. Only 2 of the four &quot;worked&quot;. Half of the trips they would stop at every floor on the way up and down. This led to lines in the lobby and an up to 10 min. Wait for a ride. On checking out, the elevator truly had a mind of its own. Went up instead of down until the last floor, stopped at every floor on the way down to the lobby until the second floor, then decided to go back up again instead of going to the lobby. If you must stay, ask for a low floor and use the stairs. <br/><br/>In the room, service was limited to making the bed, water bottles from the mini bar were never replaced (or charged for that matter) nor the room tidied up beyond the bed. 
202625744	 In my travels, I've come to realize that the staff is what makes or breaks ones hotel stay. The accoutrements are just icing on the cake. The staff there is very friendly and helpful! I thought it was just Tony at the counter checking us in, but it was the concierge staff and doormen! Tons of kudos to you guys for making my stay enjoyable! There's a Starbucks on prem that makes it even better! WooHoo!<br/><br/>The rooms are a bit small but the decor is very nice. The bathroom door opens into a small space. If you're not careful you'll bump someone for sure! The only thing is that for the price you'd think they'd have free internet....they don't. So be forewarned.<br/><br/>The location is not too far from where we needed to visit. So it made a good centralized place to take daily outings to the museums and sights. <br/><br/>I would recommend staying there in a heartbeat! 
202622479	 The Hamilton is a mixed bag. It is in a great location, just one block from a convenient blue &amp; orange line station, maybe 15 min walk from the White House and 25 min away from the rest of the fun things around the Mall. It is also a beautiful historic building. On the down side it is pricy. Its restaurant too while offering fine dishes runs easily $18-30 per entree. You would get a better view if you ask for the Park view but the traffic noise is substantial and will be with you much of day and night. The staff are friendly but seem overwhelmed. Our cleaning typically wasn't finished till 2:30 and teas and towels were not always refilled.<br/><br/>If you have 3 or more people in your group, consider taking a cab rather than the metro. The cabs are plentiful and will run you, with tip, maybe $10-12 to the Mall area and nearby. The metro will save you $5 but cost you more in time and inconvenience. Catching it from Reagan though is a great deal and you'll be only 1 block away.<br/><br/>Do walk the nearby area, e.g. to the Chinatown. There are some nice old churches in the area. 
202570651	 This hotel was perfect for our needs. A block from the Metro, a couple of blocks from the White House and a straight line easy walk down 14th Street to the Mall. It's also on the Circular bus route to Georgetown for a dollar.<br/>We had a room that faced into the alley so the back of the hotel to the square, it was perfect and really quiet and a good sized room. Would happily stay there again.<br/>The only disappointment was the charge for Wi-Fi. When 3* hotels offer free Wi-Fi, it is disappointing that 4 and 5 star's still charge. 
202393953	 Hotel and rooms were excellent,wonderful location easy to get public transport,both Metro and Bus links.The restaurant was very good,although our waiter on occasion would forget about our orders,still it was good food and a lively atmosphere.<br/><br/>Happy hour was a lot of fun and the food was good also. 
202330336	 We stayed for three days at The Hamilton on our first visit to DC and overall I would recommend this hotel. Its location is excellent, just a five minute walk from the White House and very close to a well-connected Metro station, making sight seeing very easy. Also, the breakfasts were very good. We had booked an executive room and this meant that we got a continental breakfast included and I would recommend this option to anyone as you not only get a bigger room but also good value from the breakfast - lots of fresh fruit, pastries and toast.<br/>On the down side there are a couple of things which could be improved. Without doubt the main failing of this hotel is the lift/elevator situation. There are allegedly four, but it seems that only two are ever working at any one time. They are small (max. 6 adults, less if you have luggage) and the result was tiresome queues waiting for a lift (or if one did turn up, a lift with enough space to fit in).or stops on almost every floor on your way down (we were on the 12th) as there were so many people waiting for the lift.<br/>We also had a few issues with our room but, to the hotel's credit, they did give us a courtesy call to check if all was ok and they did correct two of the three issues - the third related to a leaky seal at the base of the toilet which I guess would not be immediately fixable but was unpleasant nevertheless.<br/>However, the best thing about this hotel is the beds. It would not be an exaggeration to say that these were the comfiest beds I've stayed in at a hotel. After a long day of sight seeing these beds were amazing- super comfortable with high quality bedding, absolutely brilliant.<br/>So overall, a hotel well worth considering if you are in DC. 
155240176	 We frequently have breakfast at the Hamilton and enjoy it very much. They have excellent fruit (raspberries, blackberries, pineapple, etc. and other fresh fruits), oatmeal, omelets to order, etc. Best fruit in town. Excellent waiters as well. Haven't stayed at the hotel as we work in D.C. but have recommended it to clients and they said it was great. 
154805910	 Rooms are smaller than average but very comfortable. Kurig coffee, reading lights on bed and fridge in room. Really homey. The staff is also very helpful and the banquet food for conference was delicious. 
154777267	 Great location! Close to White House and other monuments. Lot's of cafes and shops nearby. Classy rooms, even though they are quite small. The rooms were very clean. Staff was very helpful and friendly. We definitely are going to stay there on our next trip to Washington. 
154213832	 I am an IHG Priority Club member. This is not a great Crowne Plaza. Rooms are very, very small. If you get a double, they really mean double: 2 double beds, NOT 2 queen beds. No free wifi. And the wifi is slow and not very reliable. Breakfast was good, but they charge a &quot;champagne brunch&quot; surcharge on Sundays. Even at 7:15 AM. Seriously should consider a standard buffet option. Only additional stuff was champaign (which I was never offered) and peel and eat shrimp. Neither stuff I consume at 7:15 AM. Costly hotel. Very expensive parking. Forego the hotel parking ($50) and park around the corner in the office building ($27). 
154199023	 Excellant location at a resonable price.<br/>Walking distance to all the &quot;Must See's&quot;<br/>Room was clean and tiday and staff very helpful.<br/>Resturant was very good and the bar service excellant.<br/>Would recomend for the holiday traveller.... 
154189396	 The Hamilton was perfect! Staff was super helpful, going out of their way to get us connecting rooms. The location was amazing - a few blocks from the White House and a quick walk to Georgetown. Rooms were clean and in great condition. We will definitely stay there again! 
232674490	 I was there on business, and it's a very nice place to stay at. Very nicely located. The lobby and the rooms are well appointed and staff is very welcoming. I would like to give a special thank you to the concierge - Luis. I forgot my cuff links, and he went way out of his way to help me get a pair before my Monday morning meeting. So overall, if you are in DC on business, I would hesitate to recommend this property! A little more than what I would usually pay for a Crown Plaza, but then again, it's in Washington... So no surprise :) 
232530407	 I stayed here recently on a business trip that included a conference in the hotel, and although I would probably have selfishly preferred a Marriott property for the points, I've got no complaints here. For business travelers working fairly near the White House or the K street areas, it's a quick walk or cab ride or Metro stop (McPherson square). Rooms are a little small, but not a huge surprise in a place like DC...they were certainly clean and with a comfortable bed. Although you'll always have sirens going off at all times of the day and night in DC, I slept very well. Also, there's plenty of places to walk to for eating...from nice restaurants to dive Thai food.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say it's going to knock your socks off completely, but it's a solidly good hotel 
232309637	 This is an amazing place to stay. Hotel is very fresh and rooms are pretty nicely refurbished. Good beds, nice and clean bathrooms.<br/><br/>Location is what makes this hotel a trully gem, everything is just around the corner. <br/><br/>We also trully enjoyed hotel's brunch on sunday morning, good food nice service.<br/><br/>Trully recomnded. 
231838359	 I stayed at the Hamilton three nights on a business trip. It's a beautiful older building that has been very stylishly renovated. It's conveniently located two blocks from the McPherson square Metro stop. Although there are many restaurants and shops nearby, it is in a more business-focused area that slows down after business hours. My room had two queen beds and I found it to be surprisingly spacious for a city hotel.<br/><br/>Overall the staff were very friendly and accommodating--checking in on me, offering umbrellas in the rain and providing complementary drinks and movie vouchers when some repair work caused minor inconveniences. As an IHG rewards program member, the internet usage is free. <br/><br/>This was a convenient and comfortable location for business travel in DC and I'd definitely stay there again. 
230514694	 We recently stayed at the Hamilton. It was great. The location was wonderful and really close to the metro. The DC metro is easy to use so that made this location a bigger plus. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The rooms are not large but certainly adequate - after all you are not there to spend 24 hours in your room. (leisure travel)<br/><br/>The bar and restaurant are great. After spending entire days out and about we ended up eating there 4 out of 5 nights. They have some happy hour priced drinks and food with enough variety that you could have something different each night. There are also other walkable restaurants in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>A few helpful hints. There is a Starbucks in the lobby area and a Dunkin Donuts one block up the street. There is a CVS diagonally across the street. (water) There is a liquor store on 14th Street about 1/2 block away from the front of the hotel. Take the blue line from the airport and get off at McPherson Square. All the metro stops we used had escalators. <br/>WiFi is free for IHG Reward Club members.<br/><br/>You can walk to the White House, which we did, but we did find it easier using the metro for other sights as things are spread out.<br/><br/>It was a wonderful hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and to recommend it to anyone! 
229421827	 I recently spent 3 nights at the Hamilton. It is a great old historic property in Washington. Great location and very close to McPherson Square Metro Station.<br/><br/>I arrived at approxmately 4pm to check in. Staff at the front desk was pleasant and responsive. I was told my room was not ready yet, due to being sold out the night prior. They checked me in and gave me a drink coupon for the lobby bar and told me they would alert me, when my room was ready. This was fine. The issue came when they never alerted me about my room. I waited about 45 minutes and then check back at the desk. They had a room waiting at that time.<br/><br/>The was very nice. Good size given the old historic property. Well maintained and clean. I had no issues with the wireless internet and was pleasantly surprised with the speed that accompanies the free wifi for IHG members.<br/><br/>I enjoyed dinner one evening in the lobby bar. The food was good, quick and well prepared. They have some very good happy hour food specials, especially for downtown. The selection was more than I would have selected and the happy hour pricing was outstanding.<br/><br/>The one area that needs some design and thinking are the elevators. They have four, however, due to the age of the building they are very small and only fit 8 people, more like 4 with bags. If you are on the middle floors of the hotel, it can take quite awhile to get a down elevator at rush hour times(7 - 8am) in the morning. 2 of my 3 mornings I waited 10 minutes for an elevator with each one being full when it reached my floor(8). I ended up taking the stairs both mornings to the lobby.<br/><br/>Overall a good hotel, great service and great location. 
132370032	 I stayed here on business because it was centrally located to the downtown and underground. It was also a pretty good value in comparison to the other major hotels in the area. My room was very nice and the bathroom was pretty spacious. Even though the hotel is located on downtown my room was quiet. The staff were friendly and responsive (esp. the concierge). Restaurant service was very good and food excellent. They have an outside seating area that faces the park and is very comfortable. There's a Starbucks very conveniently located on the first floor which opens early. Also if you are like me and do not know the area well- ask the concierge about transport options to the surrounding areas. It saved me quite a bit of time and effort when I found out there was a transport service that could take me directly to the Baltimore Airport. You can also take the train (AmTrack) but this involves changing vehicles and catching buses ect. A bit too complicated for me.<br/>My one minor complaint is that my room had a view of the back of the facade. It was no big deal but if you are into views ask for a room with a view (above the 2nd floor at least). My more major complaint (but NOT a deal breaker for me) was that there was no free WiFi service. There is internet service for a fee. In my humble experience most hotels are now offering this service as a courtesy. 
132183998	 Booked this room through Priceline and was happily surprised. Room was a little smaller than I expected but the hotel was built in the 19th century, can't expect too much. Food was good and an excellent value. Staff was very helpful. Only negative was a fire alarm in middle of the night. Would stay again. 
132125971	 Positives:<br/>- Bed was very comfy + fresh/new linens<br/>- Shower/ great water pressure, nice toilleteries<br/>- Location location (close to all museums, metro station, bus lines)<br/>- Service<br/>- Concierge service: very good suggestions on how to get to places and where to go for shopping, etc.<br/>- Restaurant<br/><br/>Not so goods/negatives:<br/>- internet is $13/24 hrs even for Priority Gold<br/>- the executive lounge on the 12th floor is nothing to write home about. Closed most of the time, we couldn't even find bottles of water there.<br/><br/>Boils down to : I recommend this hotel. Walking distance to all State free museums 
132017528	 I stayed here for four nights during June 2012 and had an excellent stay. The hotel is located within walking distance of all the major attractions (only a couple of blocks from the Whitehouse). I was travelling alone and I was delighted that there was such a good restaurant on site for both breakfast and dinner. They also have an in house starbucks if you need to pick up a coffee on the go. The staff were always very polite and helpful. 
132013719	 A little run down, but adequate if you want to be in the area. The room had a very “old” feeling, kind of like in an old English hotel but more spacious. Comfortable king bed, lots of pillows, and OK air. My room was on the top floor facing the square with a park, and I was not disturbed by traffic. They have a small but comfortable executive lounge but it is not open on weekends. The lounge offered a small breakfast selection but OK if you just want a quick one before going out and don't want to pay for a full breakfast. On evenings they offered drinks. On one visit they had small water bottles for guests to take, on another visit they were out of them. There was no tap even for a glass of water which I found a little strange. I understand that guests would like to take a small bottle, but they could at least have big bottles from which you could pour a glass. The coffee is not tasty, at least if you are used to European standard. I never had breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Staff very friendly and service minded for the style of hotel. 
131333497	 We stayed at the Hamilton, Crowne Plaza Hotel from 20th May until 31st May 2012. We received a warm welcome from the reception staff and our luggage was taken to our room immediately. We were upgraded to an executive floor on our arrival, our room was on the top floor in the corner and it was light and airy. There is no refridgerator in the room but ice is freely available from a machine down the corridor. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful at all times. Our room was cleaned well each day and it was very quiet in the evenings. Our complementary breakfast and access to the executive lounge helped to make our stay very special. Eden is a great host and welcomed us back each evening with delicious treats, we felt very pampered. Whenever we needed help from the concierge or at reception, the staff were always polite and friendly. The location is great and near to the Metro and the Mall. We would have liked to have had free wi-fi, but found a Starbucks a block away and took advantage of that. I would definitely recommend this hotel, we had a lovely stay. 
163601054	 We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on a trip to Washington, the hotel itself is really nice and clean, the room we stayed in was lovely! but the hotel had no character whatsoever! the staff were Ok and told you what you needed but no one wowed us, and based on the fact this is not the cheapest hotel I expected more. Also the location is not great there are lots of Hotels a lot closer to the main attractions. Another thing I noticed was even though our room was cleaned our toiletries were not replaced which I found strange as they were empty I think this hotel is more suited for busiess use or a quick overnight stay, it was not bad, but we would not stay again. 
163588999	 The hotel not only has a great location, walk distance to the White House, but also has good rooms, very clean and spacious. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There's a Starbucks conveniently located at the hotel lobby. <br/>Also good value for money, I would certainly recommend it! 
163161908	 This hotel is centrally located and great for tourists who want to see the main sites. We were only there for 24hours so wanted to make the most of our stay. We had a room on the 10th floor overlooking the park and it was lovely and quiet. The staff were very helpful and nothing was too much trouble. <br/>We used the hotel restaurant for both evening meal and breakfast and both were very good. <br/>The concierge service was great and again very helpful in organising transport to the airport..<br/>The reason that I did not give 5 stars is the cost of Wi fi at $12.95. This is expensive and is per device. Fortunately we only hooked up one phone. The air con was noisy and we turned it off however the room was extremely warm by morning. 
162983630	 This hotel is in a good location not far from the White House. It is within easy reach of the main attractions. The dining room is very comfortable and I particularly enjoyed the bar man who had some tricks up his sleeve so to speak. The bar staff were very friendly and the hotel seems busy. All in all I would recommend it. 
162951227	 Stayed here on a Saturday night in May for one night before moving to National Harbour for a conference I was in town to attend. Walking into the lobby with its vaulted ceiling, you do feel a sense of the history of the city overtake you, it's impressive.The location is fantastic, it's a relatively easy walk to almost any DC attraction, and a block from the White House. We used Priorty Club points plus cash to book the room, and were located on the 14th floor facing the park and the National Monument. The room was spacious with a king bed, and even had a small sofa under the window, more than comfortable for the two of us. <br/><br/>The decor of the room was lovely. The bed's headboard done in cloth and a map of the city on the mirror was really nicely done, and the assortment of pictures in the room really celebrated the history of where we were. All the furniture was in great shape, the carpets clean, and (always a nice surprise) lots of electrical outlets accessibile without having to move furniture! We really liked the framed print on the wall with all the quotes in the shape of a man's bust and would love to know where we could find a copy of it. <br/><br/>All the hotel staff were friendly, and we were especially engaged with Oscar in the restaurant 14K (which I will review separately). <br/><br/>Washington is an expensive city to stay in hotel wise, but is worth it for the ease of being able to walk everywhere! I would certainly stay here again in the future! 
162916241	 Very good location, good service. Breakfast quite expensive but a Starbucks coffee is just around the corner. Wifi is not free!!! Suggestion: avoid rooms on first 5 floors too noises <br/>Rooms are in an renewed old style but clean and comfortable. 
217086727	 I took the blue train from the airport to McPhearson Square, for my surprise the hotel was only one block away. My room on the 10th floor was very nice and modern, with a view of the Washington Monument. Bed super confortable, the shower and the bathroom ammenities over the top. White House and all attractions only a few blocks away....I want to go back!!! 
216933903	 Stayed here with a group and had a great rate. Rooms were comfy and clean and the staff was friendly. It's a great location to walk to National Mall and monuments. Breakfast in the restaurant was delicious. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a superb location, especially adult groups. 
216672310	 The best part of this hotel is it's location. Stay near the National Mall where restaurant options are virtually zero or stay a bit further away with access to places like U Street, Georgetown or Adams-Morgan? Stay here! There are direct bus links to all these places for $1 right at the door as well as a metro station across the road. The hotel has been thoughtfully restored and we had the best sleep due to the seriously comfy beds! Don't be put off by the Crowne Plaza 'chain hotel' badge.... This place really feels like a stand-alone boutique hotel. Bar and restaurant were good and served up some decent food. And be sure to look upwards as you check in! The view is worth it.... 
216622841	 We have been a lot of places for the 4th of July thought we would try something different. This place was great. The rooms were clean neat and really cool. The access to downtown was easy and close to the metro. We were all over town and was able to get back safe and not tired from walking all day. Lots of places to eat outside the door. Staff was very helpfully and nice. Parking was a bear but they will put it in a close garage for a price. Take the bus in or leave your car at the airport and metro in. I will be at this hotel again soon.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>GP24 
216616642	 My husband had placed a large amount of money in the drawer before leaving out the room for dinner (he didn't want to walk around the city with and and didn't want to use the safe ....&quot;men&quot; ) anyway half way home about 40 minutes away we discovered what happened. .it was around 6 pm and we had checked out around 11am and we figured it was gone..Surely between additional guest checking in I was sure someone hit the jackpot..we turned around and went back to the hotel just in case and low and behold the housekeeper turned it in to security. ..we thank her so much for her honesty. The hotel was clean, comfortable and the staff was excellent. .This just added to the great experience. . 
216535350	 The hotel looks very modern inside and welcoming. We had two double beds, which made the room spacious. It was pretty quiet and clean. The room also had a fridge and a safe.<br/>The best thing about the hotel is probably its location. You have to walk around 15 minutes to the National Mall.<br/>We ate dinner at the restaurant inside the hotel, which was delicious and not too pricey.<br/>The staff was very friendly and helpful. 
181573426	 We stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and weren't disappointed. The metro station is just 1000ft away, the White House, National Mall etc are in walking distance. The hotel staff was very friendly, we've got a room upgrade to executive floor as Priority Club Platinum member. The room on upper floors was rather small but clean and nice. Breakfast was very tasty (we upgraded for full buffet breakfast instead of complimentary continental breakfast upstairs). 
181535443	 If you are looking for a great hotel in the heart of DC, this is it! We stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza during a long DC weekend. The location is perfect, 1 block from the Metro and also close to one of many DCs bikeshare stands. The hotel is posh without being stuffy. Decor is historic and its just the perfect hotel for a walk thru history. National Mall and Monuments are 3 blocks away! Theres a very nice bar in the lobby and a Starbucks is attached to the hotel. It doesnt get better than that in my opinion. We loved it! 
181421760	 I book a 5-night stay through hotwire and got a very good rate during the government shutdown. We were given a room with quite possibly the worst view in all of DC. It is my assumption that due to the fact that we paid such a low price for the room (below the listed price on their website) that this is the room chosen for us. The heating/cooling unit in the room made a consistent tapping noise whenever it was in use. The room was decorated nicely with updated, modern, and comfortable furniture. 
181374872	 I loved the hotel rooms and the location very close to everywhere. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful . Rooms very clean and nice park view but the beds were not comfortable. But overall experience was very nice. 
181335853	 Great hotel, excellent location close to the national mall and china town. The hotel is extremely nice, the lobby is especially nice. The bed was very comfortable, the air conditioning as a bit loud (but it was not a big issue and would not stop us from staying there again) Highly recommended!! 
181335374	 Nice room, wonderful large comfy bed and great bathroom. Staff very friendly and helpful and the onsite restaurant was good. But please...can US hotels cater for people who drink hot black tea with milk! A jug to boil water and some teabags would have been perfect. Very close to the white House and National Mall. I have been disappointed with hotels chosen on the internet but not this one. 
3427371	 I stayed at the Crown Plaza April 24 - April 28, 2005. The staff was friendly and attentive. The elevators are tiny (about 6' by 6'). The food in the restaurant was delicious but priced a little on the high side. Of course this is Washington DC. There is no pool and little for children to do. My room on the fifth floor had two comfortable beds and plenty of space for one person. The TV is a little small by todays standards with a limited number of channels. There was a small bit of mold in the bathtub area that could have been removed with a little bleach. It appeared the carpets were not vacummed every day. I reported a light bulb was burned out. It was never replaced. Ice machines are on the odd numbered floors, but the one on my floor did not work. I encountered some staff in the elevator one evening and I mentioned the ice machine to them. Severel hours later a maid appeared at my door with ice and two mints. I'm not sure how they knew what room I was in. That was a little unnerving! I would stay here again for business, but would not come here on vacation. 
3417123	 We had a quick overnight visit to Washington DC.<br/>Based on other review comments I read, I booked a room for Sunday, April 24th. We loved the hotel! The room was not overly large, but definitely made up for that with the amenities. The bed and pillows were indeed the fluffiest and softest ones we ever slept on, and the towels were also incredilbly soft.<br/>We had two double beds which made the room smaller, I think if there was a king bed - the feel of the room would be larger.<br/>I agree with another reviewer - the fragrance that permeates the room is wonderful, it seems to be a very soft lavendar scent, it was extremely soothing and calming.<br/>The hotel staff was friendly and courteous. It is ironic, the only person we did not find all that helpful or friendly was the concierge. We asked her for assistance on two separate occasions, and it felt as if we were imposing and disturbing her, even though there was no one else there at either time.<br/><br/>I was able to check-in much earlier than the normal check-in time without a problem. We arrived at the hotel at 11:00am and the front desk person was able to check us in without any headaches about being there too early.<br/>I am a Priority Club member, so I asked if there were any free room upgrades - the front desk clerk upgraded us to a deluxe room with a view.<br/>The room did indeed have a great view of the park.<br/>My recommendation is for everyone to sign up for these &quot;hotel memberships&quot; it really helps you to get free upgrades - at least it never hurts to ask when checking in - you never know....<br/><br/>The rate I got was a Great Rates with Buffet Breakfast for two, $109.00. It was only an extra $10.00 more than their lowest rate. The breakfast was a standard breakfast buffet with fresh fruit - nothing fancy or spectacular, but well worth the extra $10.00 to not worry about where to get breakfast in the morning. Also the restaurant was kind enough not to charge for our kid's breakfast.<br/><br/>Valet Parking was expensive - we had thought we would be able to park on the street overnight, but the street regulations make it impossible to do that, I think the city sets it up so it is almost impossible to street park overnight. Also it felt unsafe to leave the car on the street overnight - see comment below.<br/>The great thing about the valet parking was that on the day of check-out - you have parking rights until 5:00pm.<br/>We asked the bell-hop if it was okay to have them hold our bags for the afternoon after we checked out on Monday morning - they were very accomodating. This allowed us to immediately check out right after breakfast and hit the sightseeing trail without us having to worry about coming back to check-out or worrry about our luggage or car until 5:00pm.<br/><br/>For us the location was perfect - close enough to walk to most sites. It is a bit of walking for someone not used to walking, but for us we are used walking everywhere.<br/>The major issue was food - most area restaurants are closed early or not open on weekends in this neighborhood - it is mostly business oriented.<br/>Monday was busy and there were lots of places to eat, but Sunday was very quiet. We drove out to Georgetown to sightsee and ate dinner there.<br/><br/>On Sunday - we drove around all day because parking was great everywhere - lots of street parking was available.<br/>On Monday - we walked everywhere - it would have been difficult to find parking.<br/><br/>This is just a safety comment about the city itself - there are a lot of homeless people that come out at night. It made it unsafe to leave our car on the street overnight, we felt that especially with out-of state-plates, someone was going to break into our car. If you are not used to &quot;city life&quot; it can be a bit un-nerving when walking around in the evening.<br/>We saw this everywhere that we went - even in Georgetown(which really suprised us since it was such a wealthy neighborhood)<br/>In the evening, you are better off taking a car or cab from place to place.<br/><br/>All-in-all - it was a wonderful weekend mini-vacation. I would definitely re-book this hotel the next time we are in DC.<br/> 
3414567	 this is a restored older hotel, and the recurring theme is small: small elevators, small rooms, small bathrooms. the rooms were oddly shaped, with a small window behind a pillar.<br/><br/>otherwsie, not bad. 5 minutes to the red line and 5 minutes the other way to the blue/orange lines.<br/><br/>no pool<br/><br/>some cheap places to eat fast food within a few blocks (subway, quiznos, . . . ) but some close on thew weekends since this is pretty much in a business district.<br/> 
3366456	 We stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza during the Cherry Blossom Festival in early April after reading other reviews here at Trip Advisor. We weren't disappointed. The rooms were somewhat small, but felt newly renovated. The bathroom was also unexpectedly upscale.<br/><br/>The beds were exceptionally comfortable and while the TV channel selection was limited, it included all the local network stations, CNN, The Weather Channel, ESPN, HBO and a few others. Enough for me.<br/><br/>We didn't eat at the restaurant, but found many restaurants a comfortable walk (or Metro or cab ride) away. The area gets quiet after business hours, which I found desirable. The McPherson Square Metro station is one block from the hotel. While there were some homeless in the park, it wasn't a problem for us and not once did anyone panhandle as we passed.<br/><br/>While some vacationers may consider the bellmen slightly agressive, I'm sure many of the business travelers appreciate their prompt attention. We simply declined their service upon arrival. At check-out we had all afternoon as we didn't depart DC until 7PM so they offered to store our bags at no charge all afternoon. They tag all the bags for identification and provide you receipts.<br/><br/>The hotel was a short walk from the White House and we even walked all the way to the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials from the hotel since the weather was so nice.<br/><br/>For a Crowne Plaza, this hotel is at the top of it's game. I'll stay here when I visit DC again. 
3330260	 Myself, my wife, 9 year old and mother in law went to D.C. for Easter break. We arrived on Easter Sunday and stayed for six nights. Upon arrival the bellman took our 5 bags quickly up to our room. The front desk clerk arranged for us to have two connecting rooms, which was great. The rooms did not actually have the common door inside of each room, but a separate door to the hallway and our own inner hallway where we could keep our room doors open. This was much more convenient. We stayed on the executive level on the 12th floor and outside noise was NON EXISTANT. The only down side was the view out of the room was another building, but we were not there to sit all day in the room, so it was not an issue. The rooms were average size, but very clean and well appointed. The beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in at a hotel. Our rooms each had a king bed and our room had a sofa sleeper which our 9 year old slept on, which was comfortable as well. The staff was very freindly and helpful. The location to the hotel from the nearest Metro station was only one city block. The room rate was not bad $169 a night (except Monday-$249) with a AAA discount. Overall I would DEFINATELY reccommend this hotel to anyone travelling to D.C. and will stay there again upon return trips.<br/> 
3302534	 The room was small, but well appointed, quaint, and interesting. The bathroom was a step above usual hotel-grade. Same with the bed. The desk was a little small, and the sofa so uncomfortable so as to be almost unusable, but I was walking distance from downtown, the staff went out of their way to be helpful, and the catering for our meeting was outstanding. What a surprise find! 
118133093	 The downtown location of the hotel is optimal if your time in DC calls for you to attend events or meetings at the convention center. Close to other hotels, the neighborhood caters to large gatherings and nice restaurants and lounges are in close proximity. This hotel is historic - but some upgrades have made it a nicer place to land. I had reserved a King room online, but was given a queen bed. Tight quarters for my husband and me. I quite prefer getting what I believe I am paying for. That said, the room was fine and the bathroom, spacious. Service in the restaurant was spotty - particularly if you dine on the covered sun porch. But the breakfast buffet was consistently good. Pricey? Yes. But on par with other name-brand hotels. On Saturday evening, there was no doubt in my mind that the hotel allowed local hangers-on to frequent the hotel, even look for a little action. We are seasoned travelers, not at all judgmental or prudish - but I think the managment of the hotel ought to monitor late night goings-on and ask some of these people to move along. Again, a very nice hotel did not yield a topshelf impression and the desk staff spent a lot of time engaging with them. 
118066966	 I had a beautiful king room which was tastefully decorated and a good size for DC biz traveler. The entire hotel is clean, the elevators are fast, the lobby offers a great meet-up area, there is a Starbucks accessible from the lobby area, and the hotel is very close to the metro.<br/><br/>I did encounter a few problems though:<br/><br/>1. The staff was not as all helpful when my flight was cancelled and I was to arrive a day late. When I called the hotel to alert them to my late arrival, they ended up cancelling my entire reservation. My secretary had to scramble the get it reinstated the next day. <br/><br/>2. The internet is the slowest I have ever seen, and it is free only for Crown Plaza reward members. The business center is a mess. Guests are allowed 15 free minutes to print their boarding pass. Again, the internet service is terribly slow, so it took me just about 15 minutes to get my flight page open. I had 1 minute left on the computer when I finally got the printer window to open, then I found out that the printer was broken. Ultimately, the concierge was very helpful – he was able to print my boarding pass in the manager’s office. However the whole experience took nearly an hour – just to print a boarding pass!<br/><br/>3. The hotel is right next to Franklin park, which is not a good area to be in once the sun goes down. The park is inhabited by lots of unsavory people. As I was walking back to the hotel from the metro at 9:00 pm I witnessed an assault and I was verbally threatened. I ran for my life! 
118063581	 Stayed at this hotel for a couple nights recently. I have Priority Club gold status, so they gave me an upgrade to the top floors, with free bar drink coupons and breakfast vouchers for the hotel restaurant. The hotel is a historic building, which means the rooms are small, especially the bathrooms. The hotel is nicely upgraded, but if you want a modern spacious hotel, you may want to stay at another place. The elevators were pretty slow and small too. The location is close to a metro stop and there is a CVS and a Subway restaurant if you want a quick bite to eat or snacks. 
118036914	 had a beautiful corner room with a view of the park, staff was helpful and attentive 
118020959	 Front desk staff was pleasant and check-in was fast and simple. This is a very nice hotel for the money. The location is very convenient to travel around the DC area and it is within walking distance to the Whitehouse and the Smithsonian.<br/><br/>Over all I would definitely stay here again when I’m in the DC area. 
117981113	 The hotel was nice and convenient to metro. We were able to walk to White House at night. Wonderful! 
36255452	 DO NOT get a room with a view in this hotel. First of all the view is &quot;Franklin Square&quot;, which is no big deal. Really, you're looking at K Street (&amp; it's so busy all day &amp; night long) and a bunch of homeless dudes in the Franklin Square park area. It's so loud. There are a couple of nightclubs on 14th street, and you can hear them until late hours. The homeless guy or a reveller from the club serenaded us with Jesus songs mixed with patriotic songs for all hours of the night, &amp; we were on the 6th floor. <br/><br/>Otherwise, the hotel was clean, the 14K restaurant bar was good and the people working both in the bar &amp; the front desk were really friendly and informative. The rooms are not very big. Bathrooms are clean and updated though. 
35701271	 We stayed at the Hamilton for 3 days during the busy summer month of July. Good location with a few good eating establishments nearby. The rooms are small but the bed was great. Try to get an upper floor since the hotel is on a busy street and the higher you go the less noise you get. Very basic lobby with no frills. We would stay there again. 
35314845	 Stayed at the Crowne Plaza for Father's Day - brought the parents down to spend some time sightseeing in DC.<br/><br/>The hotel is an old restored hotel; previous reviewers said it was noisy, so I e-mailed the hotel in advance to ask for a quiet room. They graciously agreed and even upgraded us to a deluxe park view room. Nice.<br/><br/>On check-in, we were greeted by a fairly unfriendly guy who barely looked at me. He offered me the room that was held, with two doubles, or a king room with a sofabed. I took the latter; however, I lost the park view and gained a wall view with this switch. Oh well - the set up suited us better. He did mention that Priority Club members get 50% off the breakfast, which I believe worked out to $9 at the buffet. Very good deal at a high quality buffet.<br/><br/>The room itself was OK, a good size and quiet. Beds were comfortable enough, and the bathroom was large.<br/><br/>Location is good, near McPherson Square metro. Note that there are a lot of hotels in the nearby vicinity - so while the location was good, it wasn't unbeatable. There are a few restaurants and nightclubs in the area, so it is fairly busy around the hotel at night.<br/><br/>All this said, we paid only $79 - weekend special - so for the price of a Holiday Inn I guess I shouldn't complain. With perhaps a slightly friendlier staff - amazing what a rude check-in does to the experience - it would be more of a winner. 
35016609	 The Hamilton is a nice hotel with a beautiful lobby. We enjoyed our stay here but found the rooms to be small. We are a family of 4 with 2 older teens and we all stayed in one room 2 double beds the first night and found it to be quite crowded. We split into two rooms and were much more comfortable. This hotel has reasonable prices on the weekend, due to the fact that it is in the business district. Unfortunately, since it is in the business district many of the small restaurants are not open after about 5pm. We were ready to go out to dinner at about 9:30pm and the restaurant selection nearby was limited. We did enjoy the hotel restaurant for dinner and Priorty Club members recieve 50% off of the breakfast buffet. We loved the breakfast buffet and highly recommend it. The hotel is not sound proof and there is a little bag in your room with ear plug to block out the street noise. On the lower level there is a computer room where you can print out you boarding pass for free. Great hotel with comforable beds but the rooms are not spacious. 
34732461	 The Hamilton is a nice hotel. The rooms are small. If possible, get 1 King bed and share rather than 2 full/queen size beds. The bed was VERY comfortable. Was able to sleep quite well without waking up with a back ache. It was very quiet in terms of the floors above &amp; below you. You could hear people in the hallways. The restaurant is good, but quite pricey. Go to the Corner Bakery a block away for a more reasonable breakfast. There are places to eat nearby. Lima is great. There are also inexpensive places, which you won't find near the hotels nearer the White House. Within walking distance of the mall if you are willing to walk about 15 minutes briskly to get there. I was there for a convention so I got a discounted rate--couldn't have afforded it without the discount. Would stay here again next year for same event. 
34332159	 This was our last stop before heading home from a 10 day vacation. I was really looking forward to staying at this hotel and I was very disappointed. I had booked this hotel 10 months in advance.<br/>The bad-we arrived prior to check in time-very helpful desk staff said our room with 2 dbl beds was not ready yet but he could expedite it for us. We told him not to worry and we would be back in a few hours. BIG MISTAKE.<br/>We returned to the hotel 2 hours later and we were given a room with 1 queen bed. We paid for a room for 3 people so we needed a king bed or 2 dbl beds. All we recieved from the staff was &quot;sorry you are out of luck &quot; and they did not have any roll-aways available. I was livid. Front desk staff was so rude and alooft. So one person in my party got to sleep on the carpet with a huge run in it. Completely unacceptable. <br/>The rude front desk staffer gave me 2 free continental breakfast coupons. In the morning we used the coupons to get something on our way out and asking for the muffins to go seemed like a huge chore to the hostess. She rolled her eyes and handed us 2 to go containers and told me to &quot;get it ourselves&quot; No talk of the juice or coffee that comes with the normally $12 continental breakfast.<br/>I was going to check in for our flights in the business center, but I didn't feel like paying the $3 fee just to log on to their computers. My iphone was a much better option.<br/>The only good thing about this hotel is its location. It was about 6-8 blocks from the mall.<br/>We were fortunate to find on street parking and did not have to give the hotel $30 more dollars to park there.<br/>Horrible stay. 
142920780	 This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had to tolerate. The lobby smells terrible. The rooms are incredibly small. The room was not made up until after 5:30. Despite the signs on the even numbered floors that vending is available on the odd numbered floors there is no vending machines in the entire building. Additionally, there is no convenience store in the hotel. To get basic convenience items that you need or a soft drink you have to walk a block to the closest CVS. Oh and did I mention, the road noise is the loudest I have ever experienced at a hotel. 
142907089	 Stayed here for a short break and was overall not wowed at all.<br/>Rooms were okay, brilliant large shower with good power but THE most uncomfortable bed I have ever slept in - really was. Can't understand why they would spend so much on the bathroom and then leave a cheap bed. :(. Plus the bedsheets were cheap cotton just for those who care about those kind of things - so felt like crinkly paper on your shoulders - but all fresh and clean. For the first time ever I have had back ache - not good at all. Also even though the room was double glazed we could hear lots of noise from outside.<br/>Service from a staff point of view was hit and miss. Either staff were really enthusiastic or really not interested with no inbetween. Which is a shame as the ones who were bad and or did not care are letting the ones who really want to do a good job. An example of this was a member of the reception team made mistakes with our booking in and then also in setting our room keys so we had to go back down to reception (tired, jet lagged and loads of bags outside the room) to sort it, no apology just an attitude almost like we were troubling them and it was our fault. We were not rude just asked for correct information and for the keys to be set as were not working. We had good service too for example the porters were lovely and helpful and the lady who arranges the transport. But overall there was more poor service than good so that along with the room noise and bed spoiled it for us and put us off and we would not recommend or stay there again. 
142832502	 The Crowne Plaza is a smaller hotel located a reasonable walk from monuments and the Smithsonian museums. The room was fine. It was clean and had enough room. Internet WiFi is not included - very strange considering the price. The restaurant is expensive but provided a quality dinner (Friday nights are busy, but Saturday is quieter). Breakfast is the main disappointment - touted as a 'brunch' - it is extremely expensive an could not even provide a pot of tea or even a tea bag and hot water. I left and my partner had just one bowl of porridge - we were charged $50 + tax.<br/><br/>Washington is an amazing place to visit, but we wouldn't stay at the Crowne Plaza again. 
142663916	 Ok...this was a no choice hotel made by my company, one I would not wish on anyone...I will start by saying about the only thing this property has going for it is the location. Hard to beat. But it ends there. I guess in fairness the need to charge $42.00 night parking is charged is about what others charge but really...a little much. The lobby is not what would be expected. Looks and feels dirty. Checkin was fine but the king room I had reserved was for whatever reason not available. So, a queen it was. Small, damp feeling and as with the remainder of the hotel a smell that just was not pleasing. Yes the place is said to have been remodeled. But even with a cleaning this place falls short. Dirty carpets and the beds will cause anyone to lose sleep they are so soft and unsupportive. Internet goes in and out so you may not be happy here either. The woman at Starbuck's downstairs said that the normal Internet service they provide was not allowed by the hotel. Only one in DC she went on to say. And at $12.95 per device per day another bad for a service that only costs pennies. So...make your choice wisely and find another property with more to offer in a cleaner setting. 
142642178	 I stayed here recently for two nights on a business trip. My room was clean, well decorated, and comfortable. I tried the hotel restaurant (14K), and loved it -- absolutely delicious dinner. The hotel is very centrally-located for a business traveler working in downtown DC, or a tourist hoping to tour the national Mall, white house, etc. I would definitely return again. 
142491488	 In a series of hotels selected by others this turned out to be quite nice. I got to the hotel late in the evening and found the lobby to be a bright and welcoming place. The hotel appears to have been renovated recently so everything was clean and fresh. My first delight was getting an upgrade because of my frequent stayer status, supprising because I don't stay at any chain very frequently. <br/>The room was big clean and comfortable. I was quite pleased with it.<br/>The location of the hotel is fine.<br/>I'd probably stay there again. 
126117331	 Hotel staff was great and convenient location however I found it difficult to get a good night sleep because the hotel faces an extremely busy street in DC. If you have business meetings to attend and require a good nights sleep then I would suggest staying at a quieter hotel that has interior rooms. 
125712337	 Traveling to Washington DC a few times a year has led to good and bad hotel experiences. This was one of the good ones. Our party of 3 arrived in late afternoon with our reservation confirmation in hand to find that our reservation had been cancelled. While we never unraveled the mystery (we do have a new office assistant who may have mistakenly reserved the wrong dates or the website booking.com could have been responsible for the error), the amazing evening manager, Walter Escobar, set about to make it right. Although he could not give us the special website price, he offered us great rooms at a sizable discount. The hotel has a cozy bar with a great happy hour which also helped take the edge off a potential nightmare. One of my associates needed a down free room - they were able to pull that together in record time. At every turn, this hotel exceeded expectations. Rooms were attractive and clean and quiet. Will keep this place in mind for our next visit. 
125461256	 I spent two midweek nights at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza the last week of February 2012. I was attending a conference and this was the package venue. I had read some disconcerting revues so my apprehension was on high alert. I was very pleasantly surprised! This is an extremely nice hotel. My room, king bed, was very nice. It was clean, had a decent bed, nice linens that actually fit the bed, plenty of creature comforts, in room coffee (Starbucks), very nice bathroom, all was very good. I purposely looked for something that was amiss and finally found something, no full length mirror. Wrong, I opened the closet door and there it was. Another observation that prior reviews had complained about was noisy rooms and thin walls, not so for me. It was very quiet inside the hotel and outside street noise was buffered very adequately. The staff was great, very friendly and helpful. The restaurant and lounge was very nice with very good food and service. It may seem pricey but remember this is downtown DC in a very nice facility. It's very competitive. Finally, this facility is very centrally located to both The White House and Congressional buildings. I would stay here again and definitely would recommend it to my family, friends and colleagues. 
124923288	 Great location. Close to metro or a $10 cab anywhere in the city for two of us. The lobby is beautiful, and the staff is great. 
124168498	 I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in October 2011. After a very long day travelling from the UK and a lost suitcase, we were relieved to arrive at the Crowne Plaza, Washington. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and as my boyfriend is a Platinum member of the Priority Club we were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The room was very spacious and comfortable.<br/>Having never visited Washington before we had no idea about location but this hotel was in a great position for sightseeing, with almost all the monuments and museums within walking distance. If you wanted to visit Georgetown you would need to take a cab. There are local convenience stores and some restaurants/cafes close by, there is also an adjoining Starbucks.<br/>I was also very pleasantly surprised by Washington itself; it is a beautiful, quiet and very clean city. All the museums have free entry and there are endless monuments to see, we did this on a night tour which was fantastic and highly recommended.<br/>If I was ever visiting Washington again I would happily book to stay at the Crowne Plaza. 
124147711	 Well located in DC. The staff is very professional. We had a pleasant stay! 
6640877	 I just returned from a girls' weekend in DC with a friend of mine, during which we spent one night at the Crowne Plaza. Arriving at the hotel was easy, and the friendly and attentive valet was right there to help me unload the car and carry my bags inside. I walked up to the front desk and was barely acknowledged by a woman who seemed to be busy with paperwork. After 2 minutes of waiting, she checked me in and directed me to my room. The tiny elevator sped me up to the 8th floor (where the smoking rooms were located) and I found my room easily. Upon entering, I noticed how cold it was in the room, so I immediately turned the heat up. The windows, even when shut, conveyed the breeze into the room, and this was particularly bad in the bathroom. The bathroom window was actually open when I arrived (the outside temp was about 35F), and even through I closed it, I could still feel when the wind was blowing. The room was nicely furnished, and I liked the sleep kit they provided, which included an eye mask, a scented linen spray, earplugs, and a sleep-sounds CD. The view from the 8th floor was great, but when standing at the window, I noticed that several large holes had been ripped through the sheer curtains. As I looked throughout the room, there were more signs of poor housekeeping and maintenance: a dead bug under the bathroom sink, hairs in the sheets, dusty lampshades, but the real kicker was the live cockroach hanging out on the alarm clock. We tried to kill him, but he got away. After going out and returning to the hotel several hours later, the temperature in the room was still uncomfortable. The heat had to be turned up very high to combat the frigid bathroom and leaky windows, which made for a very uncomfortable sleep that evening. Upon check in, we were given a voucher for two people for the breakfast buffet the next morning, but I just wanted to leave the hotel altogether, so I did not find out if the food was good. <br/><br/>In fairness to the hotel, however, I did not express dissatisfaction with my room, so they did not have the opportunity to make things right. Perhaps if I had spoken up, they would have cheerfully moved us to a clean, climate-controlled room and taken 10% off the bill. <br/><br/>In summary...<br/><br/>Pros: Great location. Some staff are very helpful and attentive. Attractive decor. Great weekend room rate with free breakfast included.<br/><br/>Cons: Frigid bathroom and uncomfortable temperatures inside. Rooms are not well kept. A bit buggy. Some staff need to learn better customer service.<br/><br/>Overall: If I used one word to describe the hotel, it would be 'spotty'. Customer service was spotty (some employees were great, but others were nearly rude); cleanliness was spotty, and temperature was spotty (literally, some areas of the room were too hot while other areas were freezing). I will not be returning to the hotel and would not recommend it to others.<br/> 
6545756	 We stayed here 11/2004. The hotel is nice, in my opinion. The bathrooms are really plush. Nice furnishings. The room was a little small but as I recall we didn't pay that much for it. Good staff. Valet parking is a must, but they do run a little slow at times. We ate breakfast at the restaurant inside and it was a buffet and it was good. I'd recommend it.<br/> 
6343812	 Stayed here because of a conference held in the hotel. Pros -- friendly staff from bellhops to housekeeping; small hotel in a nice location, comfortable bed, decent view. Cons - near a fire station so lots of alarm noise, small room, cleaning was okay not fab. -- most of all, the chairs in the resturant -- although very sturdy were not designed for a lady with a generous derrière.<br/> 
6020997	 I stayed in this hotel whilst attending a convention at the Washington Convention Centre. From that point of view the Hamilton was convenient since it is about a 10 min walk from the Convention Centre. It is close to many of the sites in what seems to be a business district of Washington. The Metro is one block away at McPherson Square.<br/><br/>Overall I would rate this hotel as an average business hotel but nothing special. The check in staff were not very friendly or helpful and indeed could be quite sarcastic. The public areas were well maintained but small. There is a rather cramped bar and a moderate sized restaurant. The lifts are very small as others have commented on.<br/><br/>The hotel room was average for a city business hotel. No significant advantages to report over other hotel chains. Each night they insisted on leaving a pack with eye shades, ear plugs and a lavender bed linen spray along side a relaxation CD to aid good sleep. This was a major selling point from the Crowne Plaza point of view - I would differ. The standard of house keeping was good - above average.<br/><br/>I ate the breakfast buffet each morning and again it was very average. Staff were mainly foreign and not very communicative or attentive.<br/><br/>I would go back to the Hamilton if the price was OK since it is in a good location and apart from the staff had no major flaws. However I would not spend a lot on staying here since it is nothing special.<br/> 
6015544	 My wife and I stayed here around Oct. 15th. She was in town for business and I flew in later to sight see with her on the weekend. As you have seen in other posts, this older hotel has been refurbushed and they did a nice job. The rooms are on the small side but are nicely appointed with tub/shower combo, desk, chair, closet, all the things you would expect in a standard hotel room. They said they had internet access but we didn't use it so I can't comment on that. The elevators are very small so this makes for some slow going at peak times in the morning. The elevator stops but it's full so you have to wait for the next one (or the one after that) I had rented a car and the daily valet cost was $28.00 plus. The first day, I went to the lobby and gave them my ticket. 40 mins. later they brought my car around. Their valet parking is not on the premises and takes some time to get to apparently. The next day I called for my car 40 mins. ahead of time and when I went down my car was not yet there. I asked and they said they would go get it right away. 40 mins. later......Anyway other than the valet, it was very central to the sights and we were very impressed with the food in the restaurant and bar. We didn't see any hookers in the bar or nearby for that matter, mostly business men drinking and winding down. I would stay again if I got the same low rate. P.S. The homeless people across the street in the park keep pretty much to themselves but I wouldn't walk over there at night.<br/> 
5901286	 This hotel has a lot going for it- Great weekend rate, friendly staff, excellent location and updated clean comfortable rooms with little extras. I found this hotel a great place to stay for my Washington D.C. sightseeing. It's just blocks from the White house. There is valet parking for a fee and even free street parking on weekends if you drive a few blocks away. Ask for a room on the upper floors and not behind the elevators, not to hear a pin drop. I will def. stay here again.<br/> 
123863970	 I stayed at the Hamilton for a business trip last week. I love being in downtown DC and the hotel was in a good location both for my meetings as well as food and fun. The restaurant was fabulous and they had a terrific happy hour with a good mix of locals/visitors. The hotel is definitely showing signs of age, and not just in the historical sense I expected. The rooms are in need of updates for decor, etc and I had a rattling air vent in my room, which was directly across from the elevator. The beds were also soft like old mattresses. I almost asked to switch rooms when I saw it but I'm not a high maintenance traveler so I kept what I had and asked that the vent be fixed, though that didn't happen. The exception to the age creep was the fitness center, which was very nice. I had read about special features for women business travelers but saw none of that while I was there. Overall it was okay, and if the reviews are correct and updates are in the future, I would stay there again, but I expected a lot more for the hotel rate. 
123627027	 This hotel is listed in historical hotels book. It is a nice building in a god location and is about to undergo a major refurbishment. While the appearance of the internal finishes is still reasonable, it will certainly benefit from the refurb.<br/>The room we had was very comfortable and was on one of the club floors but we were told by one of the reception staff that we were not to use the club facilities - why put you on a club floor if you are not supposed to take part. After a day or so, when the people providing the club facilities asked why don't we partake, we decided why not. Club facilities are very handy when your traveling - continental breakfast, drinks, hors deuvres, fruit etc <br/>The rooms and the hotel generally, appeared to be cleaned and maintained well and I would also recommend the restaurant in the hotel - food and service was very good and the price was comparable to other nice restaurants of this standard.<br/>While the hotel was within walking distance of the Smithsonian, it was easier and pretty cheap to just get a cab each way - also it meant not wasting time - so many things to see in DC. Once your in the museum area, there is one museum after the other and you are walking all day, so the last thing we needed was another walk back to the hotel. 
123223884	 This hotel is located in a great location. Right on corner of 14th and K, and only a few blocks from White House and National Mall. Great bar and restaurant. Starbucks located on site. Very quaint, boutique hotel; very clean. Staff at front desk and restaurant were all very hospitable. Rooms were well-decorated and clean. Beds were comfortable. Lobby of hotel beautifully decorated. We are staying here again on our next trip to DC! One drawback is that you are staying right in the middle of the city, so you do have some noise from street, but that is to be expected at any city hotel. 
122961875	 Main asset: perfect location in downtown Washington DC. Mc Pherson metro station across the street (200 m). Walking distance to many attractions, including White House and museums on the Mall. Nice area in the evening too with a lot of good restaurants and trendy bars.<br/><br/>Service is awesome and the hotel is overall well maintained, even though rooms are a largely outdated.<br/><br/>If you're a priority club member (loyalty program), you have access to the lounge, with free continental breakfast in the morning and refreshments in the evening.<br/><br/>Stayed here twice. Review applies for executive rooms only, no idea for other (but certainly not better). 
122945531	 We had a good experience at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. Yes, the rooms are a bit small but they are in reasonable condition and the staff were all very helpful. The only drawback is noise from other rooms but admittedly this was reasonably minimal. It's not the Ritz or a St Regis by any means but for a short stay in a great location in Washington DC it's a good choice. 
122888946	 Nice crowne plaza, restaurant has a great patio to watch the dc folks walk by. Walking distance to the white house. Service and hotel is business oriented but if you're looking for location..... 
58614351	 Short walk to White House and moderate walk to Smithsonian Museums. Metro about a block away (McPherson). Starbucks adjacent. Coffee maker in room, but stored in the bathroom so I considered it unusable. This hotel has the charm that the beautiful older structures DC boast and made the trip more enjoyable. Beautiful lobby area with ornate ceiling. Staff helpful. Stored luggage before and after check in so we could make the most of our site seeing days. Valet only parking at $36.<br/>For family dinning we enjoyed Old Ebbits grill (right by the White house) make reservations. We found a hometown pub to enjoy a casual dinner called Washington Pub and there was a Five Guys by the metro station. Other more expensive places also close by. <br/>Nice deal on hotwire and was upgraded upon check in to a jr suite. Consisted of two small rooms. King in one sofa bed in the other. 9th floor facing office building. Only slight noise from hall guests. Bathroom counter corner cut and no place to set anything and there were only towels for one person, despite booking the room for 4. <br/>HIghly recommend this hotel. Clean, comfortable and classy. Much nicer experience than a new cookie cutter hotel. 
58278103	 Chose this hotel for a long weekend visit to DC and was not disappointed. A top class hotel, and all the staff were very friendly and attentive at all times. Nothing was too much trouble for any of them. <br/><br/>We were on the secure Executive Club floor on the 12th floor and, although overlooking the street, was quiet enough morning, noon and night not to need the earplugs kindly supplied by the management.<br/><br/>The buffet breakfast, whilst not extensive, was ample for our needs and of good quality. We dined in the 14K on one night and found both the service and food of a high standard. I can recommend the bean soup!<br/><br/>The only drawback (a minor one) is the lack of evening eating places near the hotel - but with the Metro station one block away and an excellent bus service along K Street, you can get to other parts of the city quite easily.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this hotel and would most definitely use it again, should I return to DC 
56539793	 Fine hotel. I got a decent rate at $109 including parking for a Saturday night.<br/>Clean, bar is a bit small, but staff are friendly.<br/>I was on the club floor, 42 inch flat screen, decent size room.<br/>Would recommend this hotel. 
56432756	 I stayed here in a wonderful room with my mom for Daughters of the American Revolution Continental Congress. The room was nice and comfortable. The beds were very nice to sleep on. The amenities were great. 
54118145	 Strategically located downtown at the busy intersection of 14th and K Streets, the latter being home to countless lobbying firms (watch your wallet), the Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a sleek, and well manicured, business hotel long accustomed to accommodating the many visitors to the Capital – be they lobbyists or not. And speaking of lobbies, the one here is beautiful. Just look up as you enter (the front desk will be on the left). The K Restaurant, where you can avail yourself of the expensive breakfast buffet is off to the right. Once inside, there is a large outdoor terrace that overlooks Franklin Square and all of the local characters therein. If that buffet is a little beyond the budget, there is a Starbucks right off the lobby.<br/><br/>As for the rooms, mine was average in size and nicely maintained if not stylishly decked in gold pastel. Of course, the room amenities were plentiful: shampoo, sewing kits, mouthwash (if in town to crash a White House dinner), eye masks, coffee maker, hairdryer and a large umbrella in the closet.<br/> <br/>Here’s some DC trivia: this hotel hosted one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Inaugural Balls, an event that did NOT live in infamy. 
54043915	 First off, this was a leisure trip for ME, but it was a business trip for my husband. Our stay was paid for by a group that he is working for, so I can't be very hard on the hotel. That said, even if I had paid I don't know what I could complain about. The place was clean, it was newly renovated, the food was VERY good (both in restaurant and room service), and there is a Starbucks in the lobby. Recap... comfy bed, new view of Washington monument, centrally located and Starbucks. That's about all it takes to make me happy. If I were to improve this hotel I would do two things... 1. move it a few blocks over, closer to F Street. 2. greatly improve the English spoken by the hotel staff. I had a very hard time understanding everyone from bell staff to restaurant wait staff. Front desk employees were easily understood, but that was the extent. I am not a fan of boutique hotels. I like a noisy atmosphere and a lot going on. If you are traveling on business or need to relax, this is an excellent place to stay. 
53052589	 I was there with my girlfriend. The staff is very polite and helpful. We took a King Size Deluxe Room, but actually it was smaller than we expected. The room and the bathroom was clean and nice. We took a Park-view room, unfortunately the window was small and not clean on the outter side and the view was wasted because this detail.<br/>We didn't have breakfast or other meals because we prefered go outside but we appreciated the Starbucks just at the ground floor of the hotel.<br/>Pros : Nice staff, Great location ! nice rooms though small, very beautiful lobby<br/>Cons : Slow elevators, Small windows in the rooms, TV-set really outdated (not flat nor digital), Price can be very different according to the seasons (but we had it for around 100$/night). Internet connection is not free. 
52580064	 We stayed here for 4 nights over New Year's Eve and absolutely loved it! The location can't be beat and we walked to everything. The 'circulator' bus is terrific and runs right in front of the hotel and stops at all major points of interest. The subway is less than one full block away and a mere 15 minutes to/from National Airport.<br/><br/>There are a number of people manning the doors at all hours of the day and night. Most nights we didn't even get back to our hotel until 2:00 or so and always someone was there to greet us. We never once felt unsafe in this neighborhood, again, at all hours of the day or night. We didn't notice any unsavory people near, in nor around the hotel.<br/><br/>We checked-in and were upgraded to a King Suite so I'm not aware of how small the standard rooms are. However, the King Suite was beautiful but it too was on the smaller size. Everything about the hotel was 4 stars for sure. I would have given this hotel a solid 5, had the rooms been a bit larger.<br/><br/>We didn't order room service nor eat in the restaurant, however, we did enjoy happy-hour on New Year's Eve and the service, food and prices were exceptional 
52277720	 My husband and I spent two nights in DC to see some sites and get away. We were incredibly impressed by John at the front desk, as well as staff at 14K restaurant, located inside the hotel. We were mistakenly assigned a room that had some issues. We definitely noticed the issues, however we never had a chance to mention them, since the front desk approached us first! :) WOW! I approached the front desk to confirm our check out time for the following day, when John mentioned the condition of the room, apologized that we were placed there and offered us an upgrade. We were upgraded to a lovely bedroom suite on the 14th floor. As frequent travelers, I don't recall ever receiving such thoughtful customer service from a hotel. We were so impressed. We also found the food, atmosphere and staff at the 14K restaurant to be very professional and friendly. Wonderful breakfast offerings and dinner was excellent!<br/><br/>Given the service we received here, we will most definitely stay here again in the future.<br/><br/>LOCATION- Fabulous. One block from McPherson Square Metro stop, walking distance to many federal monuments.<br/><br/>TRANSPORTATION- $9.00 cab ride from Union Station (Amtrak) 2 mi. away.<br/><br/>SERVICE- Excellent customer service.<br/><br/>ROOMS- As others mentioned, this is an older historical building and the regular rooms are on the small side, compared to most Crowne Plaza Hotels. Beds are still wonderfully comfortable and the suites are fabulous. We had a super view of the Washington Monument.<br/><br/>VALUE- Excellent value. 
51956458	 The room was a very nice size and clean. The bathroom was clean and a updated with tile floor. Close to the White House and less than two blocks from a subway station. Breakfast at the hotel lobby restaurant was good and pleasant. We would stay again. 
51578520	 Rooms are a little on the small side but have been renovated. A nice view on K street but if you are a light sleeper it may be too noisy. Best to ask for a room on the other side of the hotel. Staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Metro only 2 short blocks away. 
50863243	 Do not assume that since this hotel is expensive and in a 'nice' section of D.C. that it's a safe place to stay. There are no security personnel, no security cameras in the hallways or elevators and the hotel is open to anyone who might walk off the street and to the room floors. My wife experienced this problem first hand. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who is concerned about their personal safety. 
185014608	 We loved our stay at the Hamilton Crown Plaza, Washington, DC. The location was great- near attractions, bus line and restaurants. Everyone from reservation, doormen, front desk, to 12th floor attendant- Maureen; was wonderful, courteous and helpful. The room was great with a wonderful view. The Hotel is elegant and we can't wait to return. 
184427770	 Stayed here for a staycation. Really didn't except the worst but was overly excited about the best. The beds sleep wonderful, we love that you can use the TV as a computer. The Keurig was a super plus, gone are the days of the regular coffee maker. The staff was nice, restaurant food was good and having a Starbucks down stairs is a plus (I've got to have my lemon cake :)) while we didn't use them (no reason) there were plush robes, new pair of slippers and Colgate tooth brushes. The view, location, staff and amenities will bring us back here for another staycation. 
184349170	 I was attending a conference at the convention center, just ten minutes’ walk from the hotel. It was a very quick check-in, good clean quiet rooms, new HD TV and excellent breakfast. Good hot shower, helpful staff and quick check out; what more can you ask for! 
184293783	 Stayed at this hotel last week on business. The room was lovely and it was very close to the conference centre and tourist attractions. The breakfast was very nice however I was very disappointed with the service. I stayed for 5 nights and there was not a morning when I had an enjoyable breakfast. Every morning when I went for fruit and yogurt there were no bowls and when I asked for them it took the waiters ages to provide them. In addition to this every morning there was either no bread for toast, or no fruit or no yogurt. As this was self service it would not take a magician to sort this out. I seemed to spend most of the morning searching for bowls and plates. Even the chef cooking eggs ran out of plates. This is not a cheap hotel so you would expect a much better service. 
184167410	 This hotel was just three blocks away from my office. Clean and spacious rooms. The breakfast buffet was good.<br/><br/>After a days work, it felt good to relax in their lounge for Hors d'oevres and drinks.<br/><br/>I have stayed in this hotel on two earlier visits also. The only thing that I found was that on their TV (satellite tv) channel 2 , 4 , and 21 did not work in any of the rooms due to poor signals. This has to be fixed.<br/><br/>Overall its good value for the money.<br/><br/>The staff are very courteous and friendly.<br/><br/>The front desk Manager Ravi Gaur is very helpful. 
183861340	 After the hurly burly and the bright lights of NYC, with a side trip to Niagara Falls, we had a couple of days to spare and flew down to Washington DC. We had got a deal for 3 nights with booking.com and had a king size deluxe room which included breakfast (continental) and canapés in the evening. The room was very well appointed, spotlessly clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially the Concierge who was able to give plenty of advice as to what to see and what to eat. The sad thing was that we did not spend enough time in Washington DC to visit all the museums and sights - it was a 'snapshot' visit and we shall return. The Hotel is well located within walking distance of the White House, and we accessed it from Dulles Airport by the 'Washington Flyer' coach and then the Metro. It is a very short walk from the Metro station to the Hotel. A most enjoyable stay and well recommended. I note that there are moves afoot to provide free wifi - this is to be encouraged as it was the only 'downside' to the visit. 
153885118	 I work at a hotel, so I can be a bit critical when we travel. However, our experience here was great! It was my birthday and our first night away from our baby, so we wanted it to go well. We arrived early to drop off our luggage, not expecting to be able to check in early. Joseph, at the front desk, was extremely helpful. He got us a room on the 10th floor and it was beautiful. My only complaint was that we were hoping for a great view but got one of only a couple of rooms that has a sort of concrete barrier outside of the window. We could still see the park beside the hotel and the Washington Monument in the distance, but you had to look between the pillars. <br/><br/>We had drinks in the bar (which were very pricey) and the brunch on Sunday morning. Brunch was well worth the experience! It consisted of a variety of fruit, biscuits and gravy, omelets, shrimp, bagels, lox, sausage, bacon, pancakes, french toast and more!<br/><br/>This is now our &quot;go to&quot; hotel when we visit DC. 
153771042	 No maid service in morning, nap in afternoon. Couldn't get promised service later. Wouldn't even bring fresh towels!! The location is good for convention center. Noone to help us get cab this morning. 
153714029	 I stayed for 4 days for the second time and was pleased that I had come again to this hotel. The hotel has a pleasant character and not a typical of modern 4 star hotels. Whilst I did not check out the history the hotel is a renovation od an old hotel and has a charm not seen in modern hotels. The room was very comfortable, great bed, nicely furnished and with the normal facilities one would expect. The wi-Fi was a bit patchy in the room and much better in the foyer or restaurant and bar. The staff were particularly helpful and the hotel very well located for my meetings at the World Bank - $7 cab ride and not too far to walk either. The restaurant was very good both for breakfast and dinner. 
153442436	 This hotel benefited from a renovation about a year ago and rooms and decor are fresh and inviting. Like many city hotels, rooms differ widely. All are suitable for an individual business traveler some would be tight for a couple or family. If what is outside the window is important ask for a room overlooking K Street or 14th Street. I've stayed at the hotel from time to time since 2003 and never encountered an issue of substance. Rooms are quiet. Great location for this area of K Street and I Street. Only a 4 block walk from the White House and a couple more blocks to the Mall. If planning a meeting at the hotel, check out the proposed meeting room. Some can feel a bit closed in. Al Fresco dining at the hotel restaurant, 1425 K is a delight in Spring, Summer or Fall. 
153258645	 I stayed here as a base to explore DC during the christmas season, and found it to have classic ambiance in a convenient location with a very elegant and comfortable room...the hotel has been recently renovated, but the beautiful lobby with its arched ceiling was wisely left intact, making an impressive entrance...the room was elegantly appointed and very comfortable...and the location downtown was convenient for walking and taking the metro...while other hotels had artificial decorations, the hamilton sported real greens, natural touch!...also, the front desk staff was helpful, especially miss veronica (thanks!)...surprised at some of the problems others had here, as i experienced none, and i found the quirks of an old hotel to be charming! 
153258205	 Stayed at this hotel while the wife was attending a workshop. Small but nice lobby with the desk on the left and bar/restaurant on the right. Check-in very fast, friendly and efficient. Elevators were small (8 people max) but nice to have four of them. Room was very tastefully furnished. On the small side but plenty big enough for our needs. Bathroom nice with lots of towels; great shower. TV was good but pay-per-view movie had lines all across the screen. Intended to call desk for a fix but got involved in the movie (Flight) and forgot to call so the lines could not have been too bad. Worst thing about this hotel is the outrageous cost for Internet and valet parking. Had a nice complimentary continental breakfast (a true continental with fresh pastries, cut up fruit (rasberries so ripe they exploded in your mouth) that was set up in a small dining area just near the elevators just down the hall from our 11th floor room. Not sure if they set this up on all floors. Overall a very nice experience, a bit pricey but about normal for DC. Close to Metro, wsalking distance to the National Mall, downtown attractions, even Dupont Circle (but I love to walk, it may be too far for some). Very courteous and efficient staff. 
114745474	 The hotel staff were very nice, friendly, efficient, helpful, and especially good when I left something in the room and asked to have it returned. First of all, I was surprised it was turned in, and second, the staff was very prompt to find it and help me get it back. The restaurant view is serene and pleasant with a park across the street. The location of the hotel is right in the middle of many decent cafes and dining places, so that I could get fast and healthy food and return back to work. While the room was small, it was quiet, clean and attractive. Street noise was not bothersome, either. All in all, it is a good place to work, and it will be a good place to stay when I come to DC for pleasure. 
114678624	 Loved the location...very close to the metro. The hotel room was small, but clean, quiet &amp; nice. The staff for the most part was very nice and very helpful. Had a small problem with check in and the person working the front desk was rather arrogant, but not a big deal to me. The cost of the room and the food in the restaurant was a bit pricey, but I think that's typical if you want a decent room at a good location in DC. 
114656357	 The hotel is an older building so the hallways feel cavernous and the rooms are on the small side though well furnished. The staff was good. The restaurant food was decent as well but the best part of this property, outside of its location, was the outdoor seating area of the restaurant. I was there on a nice spring week and you could view life going by around afternoon rush hour - it was one of the best spots to see life go by! 
114580749	 I traveled with girlfriends to The Hamilton Crowne Plaza for a weekend trip in May. It was absolutely wonderful. Our important booking factors were price point and location to restaurant, entertainment and Historic sites. Both were great and true to what I had previously researched. The customer service at the Hotel blew me away. Check in was quick, easy and so very nice. The front desk agent greeted me with a smile and actually made conversation with me! It was wonderful! Our room was exactly how it was advertised online and in reviews. Everything worked really well, although the AC took some time to get going. The Concierge, Innocent, was the most customer oriented person I have ever met, and I am in the business. He made suggestions for dinner, drinks and late night activities. He called ahead to get us reservations on a Friday night at a really fantastic restaurant. He even went as far as to send us drinks at the restaurant. <br/><br/>I know I mentioned it above, but I work for a 4 diamond luxury property and I took notes from this Hotel for my own property. I am used to amazing service with quality behind it and that is exactly what we experienced all weekend. I can't rave about the hotel enough. Definitely a wonderful place for friends and families! I would bring my husband and young daughter back as we were in a great location to walk to some of the DC sites. The only minor problem was the smell of sewer that ran through the lobby occassionally. It could get pretty strong, but wasn't bad enough to deter us from anything. 
114255568	 Well appointed rooms to suit this heritage hotel. Staff very attentive, great service, good restaurant, Starbucks attached. A short walk to the metro, only a few blocks from the White House and walking distance to other memorial attractions. Plenty of reasonably priced restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely recommend this hotel. 
113415285	 This hotel is great. We/ve stayed there in 2008, 2010 and looking to stay there in August 2011. Best location, service wonderful. Can't say enough good things about this hotel....just a great place. 
118910432	 This hotel was totally dedicated to the business type crowd. My mom and I were in DC to visit the sites/ museums and the concierge continuously gave us wrong information. We were not trying to see anything out of the ordinary, just the main attractions and she sent us the wrong way, gave us incorrect times, etc. The room was clean but not all that nice overall. The elevators were awful and not working most of the time. The restaurant had very nice wait staff but food was below average. Location was the only plus side. 
118800605	 This is a &quot;hidden&quot; gem in Washington DC. It's not pretentious like four $ restaurants and Hotel but their food quality is great. We tried going to a French bistro for a spur of a romantic moment but the French apparently can't pick up their phone. Then I remembered the 14 k Lounge in the Hamilton Crown Plaza.<br/>My mom raved about their brunch when she stayed at the Hamilton Crown Hotel (14k Lounge is their on-site restaurant). I've had their salad for lunch year prior and remember it being expensive but good. The atmosphere is of a bar and dining room. It doesn't scream romantic but the lighting, the quietness (not many people were dining in the part we were in) and the attentiveness of the waitress made our night. <br/><br/>The server was a professional, a professional waitress MaryBeth or as she said MB, how all waitress/waiters should be. She knew exactly what to say, do, didn't hover, didn't make me feel bad that I didn't order dessert. <br/><br/>We started with Tuna tartar and continued on with mixed green salad and oven roasted tomatoes drizzled in Balsamic reduction, the Filet Mignon, and Grilled Trout wrapped in bacon the a crab corn stuffing (Seafood special of the day).<br/><br/>The tuna tartar: artistic perfection and fresh tuna. The chips that came with the appetizer had the perfect amount of crunch that fared well with the softness of the the tuna. The salads were excellent. The balsamic reduction was sweet and was an amazing combination. <br/>Marybeth asked if I wanted my steak medium or medium rare. This is how I know she knows what he is doing. Steaks should only be enjoyed medium or medium rare. Since you should just go to the butcher and skip the restaurant if you want to eat rare, and anything cooked beyond medium is basically horse meat. I've never had a horse, but I heard their meat is tough. <br/>The filet mignon melted in my mouth. So juicy and tender.<br/>TheTrout Filet was so juicy and flaked off with a hint of a touch. No need for lemon since the fish was fresh and almost creamy in the mouth. The sides, I had the mushroom and he had the grilled veggies, were cooked to perfection. The mushroom wasn't soggy but juicy and the grilled veggies were had the smokiness that paired well with its own juices and balsalmic dressing. <br/>The service was great, and our server was happy to answer any questions we had about the entrees and to make suggestions on the wine selections. I don't drink a lot of wine, and when I do it's usually a super sweet like moscato, but both the dinner and dessert wines she suggested were not too dry for me to handle. I can say we had a little to much to drink to drive buzz drive home. The waitress suggested for us to see if they had any room. She went to the front desk and asked. We were able to get a great rate for downtown DC on a Friday night. We decided to stay the weekend. <br/><br/>Such an wonderful location to be staying while visiting Washington DC. We had a room that faced the park and it was such a great view to see the architecture at eye level and then look down and people watch. The room was Not too spacious and open but fit the bill. Shopping is at your fingertips (as we did not plan to stay the weekend) If you are looking to venture out a bit, the Metro is really close or my favorite way to explore a city is just to walk around. Washington dc is an extremely walkable city but if that's not your thing then their Metro system is pretty good too.<br/><br/>This Crown Plaza is kind of in the middle of everything with the hustle and bustle of 14th and K right there you can pick a direction and just go and you'll get somewhere where you want to be. North, South, East, or West point and go. Location means a lot when picking a hotel and this is a great one.<br/>The concierge Innocent is so friendly and even funny to boot. Very informative. Great suggestions whether you give them something to go off of your tastes and likes or not. It's a really Beautiful historical hotel. That Saturday night we went to dinner again looking for Marybeth and was told she was there only to find out she was off. Our service was horrible. A waitress was very bubble but you could tell she was getting off soon as I heard her say she was going out. I saw her on her phone in a little room in the middle of the restaurant. I had to ask the bus person to get the check so we could go. ALL in ALL. I enjoy the stay. Food was good rooms were clean and a great Location.IF you stay I would really try and get Marybeth as she know her stuff. also Ryan at the front desk was so helpful with the toiletries bag as we were not planning to spend the night. I will come back and send my friend even though I live only 30 miles away in Maryland. 
118757277	 We stayed at the Hamilton Crown Plaza Hotel in September, 2011 for four days. There were four women in our group, and as reward customers, we were upgraded to a suite with a sofa sleeper and rollaway bed and free internent. The room, service, and all of the amenities were excellent. We especially enjoyed the hospitality area (continental breakfast, after work snacks/drinks, and dessert bar). The staff were attuned to our needs. I can't say how much we enjoyed our stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel, not only for it's location, but also for the wonderful amenities. Would definitely come back! 
118678124	 Lovely comfortable rooms although a little on the small side. Stayed here with my family and it was a nice place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. Everyone was very nice and helpful. THey even had towels and cold water bottles available for early morning joggers. Will defenitly be staying here again. 
118248468	 This was a great hotel, we had a great time there Mr Brown @the front desk was so very helpful with ever thing we ask, the staff there was the best a great hotel to get away thank u for a great getaway,see yall soon 
118161642	 We stayed Sept 1st/Sept 5ht. Out of 4 elevators 3 did not work the entired Labor Day weekend. We decided to use the stairs only to realize the lights on the first floor were not working the entire weekend. As a Crowne Plaza fan all over the nation- this facility does not meet the expectations.<br/>The rooms are nice and the bathrooms are great- just wish they did not keep the coffee pot in it. The TV only provides you with paid programs so it gets expensive. Windows are worthless as they face the a/c chillers and motor noise makes your crazy.<br/>Mary Beth at the restaurant makes the stay worth it- if you decide to stay make sure you ask for her when you eat at the restaurant. GREAT SERVICE-FABULUS FOOD <br/>Way out of the loop and fun areas of DC- never again 
180191133	 We recently spent 5 days in Washington DC during the government shut down and the best thing about our visit was the hotel we stayed in. Lovely room with comfortable bed. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet was great, although the dinner menu at the restaurant was quite limited. Even though the trip was marred by not being able to visit much, the concierge recommended a trip to Mount Vernon and Arlington Cemetery that turned out to be quite interesting. One bad thing - small brown ants appeared in the bathroom one night but were quickly dispatched and never returned. 
180072430	 One of the nicest hotel I've stayed in.Very modern,luxe,beautiful decor.Can we talk about the location? right on 14th &amp; K streets,no need to take a cab if you're coming from Union station,you can take the bus going to Georgetown for only $1 and you get off right there ON 14 &amp; K Streets. The lobby was execeptional,very fancy stunning chandelier.Though the 2 people @ the reception desk that morning upon checking were very rude,the rest of the staff were extremely nice.They had an ipod dock station which was really nice I love having the music on while I sleep.The room was a very nice size,cleaned,amazing bathroom.I always ask for room a window fro natural light(its the photograher in me I guess). The bed was so comfortable,better than sleeping on my own bed(yeah I said it)<br/>P.S. they will add 75 per day for accidental charges which willl be refunded upon checking out(its annoying since it wasnt noted anywhere on the resevation)so bring extra cash if you're staying longer so it doesnt mess up your shopping etc...<br/>overall it was amazing,I wanted to just move in. 
179850788	 We stayed here for three nights at the start of our holidays this September. Our room, 1115, was on a corner location facing 14th street. The bed was a king size with a mattress topper (?) making it very comfortable. As it is up the northern end of the city it is a couple of blocks' walk to the White House, and a few more to the Mall and monuments, which we didn't really mind. The front desk staff, concierge and front door attendants were friendly, polite and helpful. There is a bar and restaurant attached to the lobby, where we had the buffet breakfast, with enough variety of hot and cold food to satisfy most people. The only negatives were the room air conditioner was noisy and, as the windows were bolted shut, there was no option for fresh air. The other down side was that, being a front facing room, there was a lot of garbage truck noise early in the morning, but you get that pretty much in most city hotels. I would advice asking for a side facing room. Overall our stay was pleasant. 
179717441	 Stayed here for three nights on a Travelzoo special. Thursday night - $179, Friday &amp; Saturday nights - $109 each. Deal included two tickets for free well drinks in their lounge each day and $25 credit for food each day. Overall, we felt it was a good deal for this hotel. The location is great, just a block from the closest Metro station and about a 15-20 minute walk to the national mall depending on your pace.<br/><br/>We were upgraded from a King Parkview room to a Jr. Suite at check-in. This was appreciated and the room was quite spacious and nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only complaint we had was the poor soundproofing in the outer walls/windows of the building. Our room faced an alley and even though we were on the 5th floor, we could hear every delivery, garbage truck, etc. almost as if the windows were open.<br/><br/>The on-site restaurant, 14K, was very good. We ate there several times thanks to the $25 credits. Breakfasts and dinners were well above average. One evening, we ordered room service and that was very good as well.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a very nice stay and I wouldn't hesitate to choose this hotel again when traveling back to DC to see more of the sites. 
179716500	 I've stayed at the Hamilton a number of times over the last few years and it's become my favorite hotel in this part of Washington, DC. It's quaint but not cramped. More of a boutique hotel, which I prefer. I didn't realize it was a Crowne Plaza property until looking it up to write this review.<br/><br/>Very close to National airport (about a $15 cab fare), Capital Hill and all the surrounding wonderful attractions. And the price is very good for this city. You can walk to most major attractions. 
179387897	 I chose this hotel for location from Reagan airport &amp; ease of access to sight seeing in Washington. The food was reasonably priced and the room was comfortable. Staff such as concierge Andre made our stay even more memorable with helpful advise on how and what to see during our three day visit and barman Sam with his entertaining manner. All staff were very friendly and this makes for an excellent stay. 
84973504	 This hotel was filthy - I found more stains than I've seen in an inexpensive motel. My room had scuff marks on the wallpaper, rips in the lamps, snags in the bedspread and curtains, and stains all over the floor. I found stains on four different pieces of bedding - a blanket, the sheets, a quilt, and a second set of sheets. I also found stains on the towels. The second night, when they made my bed, they didn't even put the sheets on right - they were on the bed sideways. I asked the front desk to change them and they said they'd send someone up but never did. I submitted a comment through the hotel's website about the awful state of the hotel and never heard anything back. I would not stay at this hotel. It was really gross and dirty. 
84657763	 I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights. First, the lady at the reception was so unfriendly, no smile, no hello, no welcome. just 'wait till i finish talking on the phone'. She didn't explain us any hotel rules or didn't ask if we have any questions or need help with smth, just told us our room number. When we came to our room - we liked the design and atmosphere, even though it was extremely small. Huge TV made us feel better. After that we were upset with internet service - it is not free, you have to pay at least $13 a day for AT&amp;T wi-fi network. This is ridiculous! We paid $350 for our 2 nights in a historic hotel with 'great brand/customer service promises&quot;, and now we have to pay to get access to the internet??? My husband said- 'what do you expect from a hotel in Washington DC??'. Well may be i was expecting too much, but I traveled a lot around the country and stayed in different places but never saw smth worse for the money we paid. In the morning I wanted to enjoy a 'a full Starbucks service' - which is a Starbucks coffee bags in the room, but when i opened the top lead of coffeemaker - the surface inside was either dirty or moldy, i don't know how to explain it, but i decided not to risk and not to make any coffee with this thing. I took it downstairs to reception - aw, im sorry - receptionists were too busy - somebody from a front stand took it from me and said that i will have another coffeemaker after room cleaning. Never happened! I guess housekeeping didn't even paid attention that coffeemaker is missing in the room. Of course next morning when we were checking out at the reception stand - they didn't even knew about that coffeemaker situation. Also a day before we called and ordered airport shuttle for 3.30 pm. Nobody told us how much it is going to be or gave an advise that there wld be a huge traffic on our way to airport so we cld get a shuttle earlier. At 3 p.m. they told us that our driver is here and we sat in the mini-van. As we found out it wasn't our ride and that we didn't even have a reservation for 3.30 - so no one from the front desk made this reservation for us. That wasn't nice to hear and we ended up paying $20 more for our ride than what was told us at the reception (whenever we asked them). <br/>Of course there were some nice things at that place, but the whole impression was awufull and I would never recommend this hotel to anybody. 
83660461	 Hotel staff was very nice; rooms very nice, but outside traffic extremely loud. (they gave you earplugs for a reason!!!) Location was good, although few good restaurants close and many homeless people in adjacent park. Hotel itself was nice, although, not happy with one waiter at restaurant (indifferent, etc) wouldn't have mattered that much, but pretty expensive place...expect to be at least acknowledged( how's your food? etc.) Manager of restaurant very nice and apologetic, however. 
83357894	 My wife and I stayed for 7 nights at the Hamilton for a vacation in Sept/Oct of 2010 and would highly recommend it to friends and family. The two things the hotel had going for it the most was the location and the price. It is within walking distance, 1 and 1/2 blocks, of the Metro and just a few blocks to the White House. When we were delivered our bill the morning of check out, we thought they must have forgotten something because the total price seemed so low for the week. I had booked the room almost a year in advance through our Priority Club account through Holiday Inn. We got the room for $79 a night! We took advantage of the 50% off for breakfast at the hotel restaurant each morning because of being Priority Club members. The food and service couldn't be beat. The only down fall I would say is the lack of restaurants in the area. But we solved that by catching the Metro and exploring other areas of town to eat and explore. 
83135143	 The location of this hotel cannot be beat - two blocks from a Metro stop, near tons of restaurants and bars, and a doable if longer walk to the White House. Rooms are small and could use a renovation as they are a little shabby and worn - the plate over the electric outlets in my bathroom was coming off, the bathroom mirror had a long scrape on the frame, the tub was chipped, and one lamp had to be shaken gently to come on. Noise is another negative - they give you earplugs, use them! as I learned the hard way. Rooms are not at all soundproof; try to get one away from the elevators. <br/><br/>Service was generally good at the hotel, although our group had difficulties with the sales department and our group booking. <br/><br/>The restaurant in the hotel has pretty good food for prices comparable to area restaurants. Here's a tip: be sure to join the Priority Club before you stay here, as members get 50% off breakfast.<br/><br/>All in all, a decent place to stay at the right rate - but I'd make sure I got a deal on the rate before going back! 
82742697	 This hotel is in a great location, however, if getting ANY sleep is important to you, please find somewhere else to sleep.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that they give you earplugs in the room. It's extremely loud in some of these rooms. I mean street noise ALL NIGHT LONG. I don't know what's with the structure of the hotel but it's as if there is absolutely no soundproofing of any kind. It's as if your bed is right on the road.<br/><br/>The beds are comfy but it won't help you sleep. In addition, my room was sooooo small, that just to open the closet door means that I had about 3 inches between the bed and the door. Also I had a room with 2 double beds but there are only 3 tiny dresser drawers. Where were we suppossed to put our things?<br/><br/>The desk chair was right next to the bed. I don't know how taller or larger folks are going to survive this.<br/> <br/>The bathroom was &quot;odd&quot; in that you could see the pipes under the sink which by the way is where the coffee pot is located. YUCKKKY!!<br/><br/>Also there are 4 elevators that are very small and slow. Geez!!<br/><br/>If you weight more that 135 pounds or are taller than 5'5&quot; you will be VERY uncomfortable in this place. (well some of the rooms anyway.)<br/><br/>The worst of it is the noise, if you are offered a park view, refuse it. It's just too loud for anything. When talking to the front desk, they try to pretend that the downtown location is always loud. I just looked at them dumbfounded. <br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that I have stayed at various downtown DC hotels facing busy streets and was able to sleep like a baby. This place just won't due. If I were at a motel 6 or something like that, I would have expected this, but not here. They should be ashamed. Beleive me they are not. It's a great location and folks will always stay here. I say, &quot;Save your cash&quot; if getting a good night's sleep is important to you.<br/><br/>MC 
211334009	 Stayed with family whilst on a road trip, and for the helpful valet to the very professional and sociable check in staff it was a fantastic impression (especially as we arrived quite late). We had some of the basic rooms though were still some of the biggest we have stayed in whilst in the US. Very clean and updated rooms. Breakfast was very well serviced and felt attended to at all moments, buffet items were quite limited though. Had a grumpy waiting person in the bar (arrived 10 mins before closing), ought still time to persuade to pour me a drink. Pretty great location for the main DC tourist sites too, only 15 min walk to the Hill and 5 mins to the White House. Great stay, very happy 
211271654	 It's not often you find such a great hotel in a central location which is available at down to earth prices. The service was very attentive and a wonderful breakfast. Parking is off site but even after adding this in, the prices were still less than half of what you'd pay in London for the same service. All the major sites are within a 10 (White House) to 20 minute (Lincoln Memorial) walk. 
211144121	 I traveled with my family of 5.( Kids 1,4 &amp;11) we had a great view of the nearby park and washington Monument. Hotel service was Outstanding and very accommodating. We made sure to choose a rate that included parking (valet is only option @ $45 unlimited daily if you don't choose a rate with parking), we walked to the attractions and many nearby restaurants. The only downside beds are small (double), rooms Are tight but expected due to the area, no fan in the bathroom. All in all a great experience and the hotel dining was fabulous! No pool or kids activities but we knew prior to booking. 
210988682	 The hotel building and property is very nice looking including the exterior, foyer and room.<br/><br/>There were a few disappointing aspects of the hotel.<br/><br/>1. Wifi is not free - approx $13 per day<br/>2. The business centre is poor and charges by the minute for usage and per page for printing<br/>3. The room service did not fully replenish stocks in the bathroom<br/>4. The cleaning by room service was not up to standard expected for a Crowne hotel<br/>5. If you order room service food there is a $3 service fee and automatic 21% gratuity<br/>6. there is no pool<br/><br/>I will note that the doormen and concierge were excellent and all very helpful.<br/><br/>The location is good, not too far from the whitehouse and close to the metro. It is however a fairly long walk to the other major sites, which can be tough in hot summer weather. 
210881224	 The first day I checked in, the toiletries were placed nicely in order, and when I open one of the bath gel, it was empty, so as the shampoo and conditioner. Had to call house keeping to deliver new ones. The shower tiles have mildew in them, they look dirty. Stayed here for two nights and had a hard time falling asleep; the air conditioner keeps on going off every half hr; the pillows were so flat there is no neck support and they gave me a headache. It is the second night at 4AM, I called front desk and asked if they have foam pillows; the guy told me they do; when the pillows are delivered by an African man, I told him these are not &quot;foam&quot; pillows, he said:&quot;yes, these are firm pillows!&quot; I was so frustrated and said:&quot; I asked for foam pillows&quot;. He said:&quot;yes, these are firm pillows. These are all we have!&quot; He looked annoyed. I didn't want to argue so I closed the door. I was up all night. I have free wifi being an IHG member, however, when I tried to use the computer in business center because wifi was extremely slow; they said its under a different system and I have to pay to use it. This is a horrible experience and I will NOT recommend anyone to stay here. 
210852878	 This hotel has a great location in downtown DC and in within walking distance to everything. The hotel staff was very nice, including lobby, registration and restaurant. My room included breakfast, and the food was good quality/value. Overall, my stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza was great! 
13831017	 My wife and I just got back from an extended weekend stay in DC and, overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Hamilton. If it wasn't for the relatively low price, we would have rated them simply average. Hate to dwell on the negatives but this is everything we didn't like:<br/>Our first room smelled strongly of smoke but while they switched us, they didn't bother to apologize and they didn't warn us that they were moving us to the pet floor. We would have accepted the switch (if that's truly all they had) but they should have warned us beforehand that there might be some barking at 6AM. <br/>The mattress on the king size bed was fairly saggy compared to our home bed and the pillows, while numerous, were mostly poor quality (small and lumpy).<br/>Internet access is extra, free TV channels are few, and there's no material in the room on local restaurants, attractions, etc. Concierge was helpful in this area but not particularly knowledgable (especially regarding restaurants). <br/>Valet parking service was awfully slow in retrieving our car (25 minutes) and they were brazen about bumping people in queue. In other words, if you want to be treated first come, first served, tip them first.<br/>Elevators were extremely small (4 people) and stair access was both hidden (unmarked) and limited. There's only two narrow sets of stairs from the lobby, for instance, and one of them is key-code locked for employee access only.<br/>Breakfast buffet was average, at best, and $45 for two didn't make that hurt any less. Service was average all around as for every good service employee there was at least one bad one.<br/>For the money, we'd stay there again but if can get within $50 of the per-night price, we'll be giving someplace else a shot at our patronage. (We paid $115 a night, btw)<br/><br/>What we liked: <br/>2-3 blocks walking distance from the Metro, several good restaurants within 6 blocks (esp. Acadiana), and numerous Starbucks and CVS pharmacies surround. 
13797039	 I spent two nights there in February. The hotel is clean and the staff friendly. The Internet service is not good. As I checked out, I told the desk I was dissatisfied with the service and they took the charge off my bill. It cost almost $10 for a 24 hour period.<br/>The wireless keyboard in my room didn't work good and many pages wouldn't load, so it was difficult to do some of the searches I wanted, such as map searches.<br/>The homeless people in the park across the street can be persistent, so it is best to avoid the park. The metro stop isn't far away and it is a comfortable walk to attractions such as Spy Museum and areas near there and the Convention Center.<br/>The restaurant in the hotel, 14K, is also very good and the wait staff is courteous and helpful. 
13743092	 In this city of over-priced hotel rooms, the Hamilton Crowne Plaza is often a bargain (as it was for my recent stay). The service was great. They have a bathrobe in the room, free use of the nearby health club, the sleep amenity kit, and other stuff. <br/>Location is fairly handy.<br/><br/>If your weekend travels take you to DC, be sure and consider this property. 
13730852	 I found a better price than what the hotel's own website offered on orbitz, so I called and asked if they would honor that price. They said yes so I booked a &quot;king deluxe&quot; room for Saturday 2/16 for $119, Valet parking was an additional $30 (standard for downtown DC hotels). To find my way, I plugged the street address from the website into google maps, printed that out as well as several other destinations for our 1 night there. I was planning on using the printed map as a back to my often misleading portable navigation system in my car. I still couldnt find the place on my first try. That turned out not to be due to map or GPS inaccuracies, but the lack for a &quot;Crowne Plaza&quot; sign. Turns out the side of the building just says &quot;Hamilton&quot; real big on a banner going down it (that word was omitted from both orbitz's and the company's website). Once we found the place, a valet was right there to park my car, and there was no wait to check in. The clerk at the desk informed me that my VISA check card that I was using to pay could only be used as debit (never entered a PIN so I'm not sure how that worked), and they would put a $75 &quot;incidental hold&quot; until about 24-48 hours after check out(more on that in a minute). <br/><br/>Our room was on the 11th floor and nice enough. The view from the window was facing another side of the hotel. A large very clean and new looking bathroom was just past a sink area off the entry hallway. Very nice sink and vanity area. New looking faucets, huge mirror, and an additional 5x vanity mirror. Plenty of single serving toiletries-shampoo,conditioner,lotion of some sort. <br/><br/>The bed was an as promised king size with at least 4 more pillows than necessary (my girlfriend appreciated them). I found the bed to be pretty hard and had trouble staying asleep. Another issue that affected my sleep was the noise. This hotel is on the corner of 14th and K street, and even past 1am and 11 floors up,obnoxious cab horns prevented a peaceful sleep.<br/><br/>We contemplated breakfast before checkout, but anything decent was at least $10 per plate, then they add in $3 delivery charge and 21% gratuity. I know DC isnt one of the cheapest cities in America, I have no problem dropping some cash on good food, but I do have a problem with paying $30 for a breakfast that would probably be as medicore as the rest of this hotel.<br/><br/>This trip was a Valentines Day Gift to my girlfriend. After check in, we took a cab to Union Station for some shopping. The basement food court seems like you're in another country. More international food selection per square foot than any mall I've ever been to. The shopping was decent, my girl enjoyed the Express and Victoria's Secret. Later we had dinner at Legal Seafood which was delicious! We walked around for more shopping until we went to the Lisner Auditorium to see comedian Daniel Tosh (hilarious!!!). After that we just went back to the hotel for a quiet evening with some icecream and sleep. <br/><br/>Something I did appreciate about DC was the standard cab rate. there were no meters in the cab. Rides are priced based on how many &quot;zones&quot; you traverse. None of the places I mentioned were out of our &quot;zone&quot; so it was $9 to get everywhere. Just dont expect to hear any american radio during those cab rides.<br/><br/>The only problem I had for the whole stay was the hotel put a hold on my VISA card for an additional $211. Being that this the weekend before President's Day, I wasnt able to correct this until Tuesday. One call to the hotel's accounting department, and I gave the lady my bank information, she contacted my bank and rectified the problem with no additional fuss. 
13378994	 This hotel is an excellent value. My wife and I live in the 'burbs, so we overnight in the city when we come into town for dinner, theater, etc. The location is right along K street across from Franklin Square. The White House, Lafayette Square, Convention Center and METRO stops are all within an easy 10 minute walk. Staff and rooms are high 3 star-low 4 star range, but the low cost pushes my assessment into the mid 4 star range. A note of caution, there are some homeless/vagrants in the local area. They are not overly aggressive, but if you are not comfortable with an urban background, be advised you will encounter these people walking in the area. I never felt threatened, but I want everyone to have full disclosure. Valet parking only. Cost is $30. They had a challenge getting my car in a timely manner (took over 40 mins) so the charge was taken off my bill (front desk mgr insisted, I did not request it). Again, my assessemnt, excellent value. 
13128732	 I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for four days after Thanksgiving 2007. The hotel has an intimate feel compared with other large chain hotels. The staff were always friendly and courteous, the room was spacious and most importantly, clean. The extra touches of the drape clip, night light and Sleep Advantage CD made my stay a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>The hotel is in a good location - in walking distance to the White House and other Washington monuments and a CVS drugstore is just up the street for any last minute requirements <br/><br/> Would I stay there again? You bet I would. 
21226347	 I was booked to stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza through my company. Needing to be near the Convention Center, my whole department stayed at the HCP. From the very beginning, service was awful. The front desk staff were rude and they were adamant about obtaning our credit card for hotel fees, even though we insisted that everything was to be charged to our company's master account. Upon discovering we had adjoining (TINY) rooms, we requested new rooms. We returned to the front desk, and insisted on having larger rooms that were not joined. At first they insisted all rooms were the same size, but we quickly clarified we had just walked passed a more spacious room. The management told us to return in a few hours, and they would try to accomodate us with new rooms. <br/><br/>After checking in for the 2nd time, we arrived to our new rooms-- and the awful stench that came along with them. The smell was horrid; we could not tell if there was some type of sewage problem, but the rooms smelled like rotten eggs. The hotel is older, so we chalked it up to old pipes (even though the hotel boasts a recent renovation-- must have been purely cosmetic).<br/><br/>Overall, the service at the hotel is poor. The front desk staff is rude and unfriendly. The location is good if you want to stay downtown-- Metro accessible and near dozens of great restaurants and nightlife. Several co-workers complained of not being able to sleep due to noisy pedestrians. However, if you want a good night's sleep and the ability to breathe fresh air, the Hamilton Crowne Plaza is not for you. 
20821360	 I have a family of 5, and we took an overnight trip for the kids to see all the sights in DC (we brought an air mattress to accommodate our little guy). We called the property directly and they dropped $20 off the rate for a Thursday night stay ($209). Also, inquire about kids under 12 eating for free, for me this savings more than made up for the menu prices (normal for a city hotel, but high if you are used to under $20 dinner entrees).<br/>The hotel was clean and all of the staff was friendly and helpful and quick, (ie. we called for extra towels &amp; the bellman at checkout,,,both were at our door in less than 5 minutes.) The hotel had all of the amenities you would expect, and in contrast to comparable hotels, the rate was excellent. We ate at the restaurant for dinner and breakfast,,,the food was great, and excellent service. No complaints. Good hotel for all, ie. families, business, etc. <br/>We would definitely stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza again. Also note,,,I paid to stay here instead of using my hotel points at a rival chain due to the other DC hotels getting bad reviews. No regrets, we had an awesome time at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. 
20568656	 We were in D.C. for a convention for my husband and stayed at The Hamilton. What a lovely place! I gathered that The Hamilton is in a very old building, because our room was on the smallish side, but it was beautifully appointed (possibly recently rennovated?) and not cluttered at all. <br/><br/>I was impressed with the &quot;night kit&quot; we received - there was a cd with relaxation techniques, lavender spray, ear plugs, and eye mask. The bed was delicious! High thread count sheets and a cozy comforter, so the accommodations were perfect.<br/><br/>The hotel staff was very nice and solicitous - super attentive to our needs and desirous to please, from the desk attendant to the concierge. We will go back! 
20182517	 Loved, Loved, Loved the location. Just a few blocks from the White House and 1 block from the Hamilton Metro Station. <br/><br/>Upon Check in, we were told that our room was not ready. However, the woman at the front desk gave us two keys. One was to a room on the 6th floor, the other was to our originally booked room on the 10th floor which had not been cleaned. She did not recommend the one on the 10th floor because the elevator doors opened near the door. When we checked both rooms out, we chose the room on the 6th. It backed to the elevator, which we would only hear when in the bathroom. The view was an office building atrium. It was so quiet. Loved that, especially after hearing on this forum how many of the rooms were loud at night. Did not need the earplugs! <br/><br/>After waiting for our bags for over 45 minutes, we simply went down and got them. The bellhop was just sitting next to them talking with the doorman. So, we saved a few dollars on that tip.<br/><br/>Our room did not have the much advertised &quot;7 Layer Bed&quot;...or even nice bedding for that matter. We were told on this forum and when booking the hotel that we would have down comforters and featherbeds. However, both rooms we looked at did not. Our bedding was somewhat oldish and stained and the blankets were thin and scratchy (my 17-year old called them &quot;granny blankets&quot;). We inquired at the front desk and they told us that they no longer carried those because people complained they were too heavy! I called the hotel's local number/front desk from my cell phone and inquired if they carried the &quot;7 layer feather bed&quot; and was told that they did and it was so comfortable. So...not sure what was up with that. I did complain after returning home and received $30 in hotel credits. However, being lied to kind of ruined my great impression of this hotel. It seems petty, but we felt as if we were given a &quot;budget&quot; room or something.<br/><br/>One of the negatives of this hotel is that it is in the heart of the business district and there is hardly anywhere to eat, especially during the weekend when many of the restaurants simply shut down or only open after 6ish. There are quite a few Subways tho and they were open during the weekend.<br/><br/>We made the mistake of going to the 24K restaurant. Yuck. After the waiter talked me into the soup and salad bar (I'm a vegetarian and there were no vegetarian dishes on the lunch menu), I found out that the soup was chicken noodle (obviously not vegetarian) and the salad bar was being taken down because it was closing in 5 minutes. The service was absolutely horrible at this restaurant! It's horribly overpriced and my son's hamburger was terrible. The waiter left in the middle of our meal and his replacement forgot to check on us. <br/><br/>We loved the historical features of this hotel...even the tiny elevators. In spite of the subpar service, we made the most of it and really enjoyed our stay. Staying here added to the enjoyment of visiting all the monuments and museums. If the service would have been as great as the hotel, I would have given this hotel 4 stars. 
18585059	 We initially had an excellent experience when checking into this hotel. Valet, doorman, desk person and bellhop were very helpful and nice. Should point out that the desk person explained upon checkin that we were elligible for 50% off breakfast due to our membership in a travel program and gave me a letter that mentioned this and other benefits. Stayed in a corner room on the third floor which was a bit noisy (hence the earplugs in the room) but we got a good rate so no reason to complain. Breakfast in the restaurant was great and the maitre'd and waiter were very attentive. The charge for the breakfast buffet was $15 per person. <br/> The only negative, and for me it was a big negative, was the attitude of the desk person on checkout. I pointed out the 50% discount for breakfast and he said &quot;We're not giving you 50% off breakfast&quot;. I showed him the letter that I was given at check-in and he said that it was for people of a higher status. I asked then why was this brought to my attention at check-in. He spent about 5 minutes typing stuff into the computer at which point I told him to charge me full price and I would dispute the charge. He did eventually give me the discount but it completely ruined the great great feeling I had up to that point during our stay. 
17908059	 Three night stay in July. Overall very pleased with this hotel, it's in a good location within walking distance to may of the top spots in DC and close to many decent restaurants and bars.<br/><br/>I was given a corner room on the executive floor (I had paid for exec floor accommodation) . This had double aspects and the room was very bright and airy. It was not huge but totally adequate, two very comfortable beds and linens etc pretty decent. Air con was very efficient and was well used given the scorching temperature outside. The bathroom was also a fairly reasonable size and well finished.<br/><br/>There's evening drinks for guests on the exec floor, but this is only from Monday through Thursday, so two nights of the stay this was not available. Trying to get a coffee there one morning also proved a somewhat tortuous experience! The room could also have done with a mini-bar, I was surprised this was missing.<br/><br/>Bar and restaurant reasonable and all staff I dealt with were friendly and efficient. <br/><br/>This is a good choice for s stay in DC. 
159524597	 We found this hotel to be in a great location for sightseeing. The staff was very friendly and our room was comfortable and very quiet. The restaurant at the hotel had some very good food and service. 
159486261	 Lovely hotel, very nice area, beautiful classic architecture throughout. Centrally located near the WH, restaurants, public transportation, bars and shops! The room was very comfortable, with a calming, relaxing décor. AC and Hot water was never an issue as reported. 15 minutes from DCA airport. Thank you to the professional front desk personnel, *Ms.Veronica*, Ms.Dielo, Ms. Nicole Gebeck and Mr.Duskett. Thank you club room person, Ms.Tomeka Brooks. Thank you to Bell/Doormen Mike Smith and Kinte Nance. Thank you to concierge Andre Barriteau for the tour. Bravo All!! 
158950786	 We stayed here for 2-3 nights and we generally liked what we got. The location is the prime argument for staying in this hotel if you asked me. The other things are I guess ok, even though having a Stabucks in the lobby is amazing. 
158874422	 Location: the White House is only a few blocks away and you can easily walk to most attractions. If you prefer the safe and clean Metro, the McPherson station is only one block away. There are a myriad of great restaurants within walking distance, and the area is bustling with activity.<br/>Comfort: My bed was extremely comfortable, the shower was excellent with a good shower head, good water pressure and nice and hot. I had a room on the street, 911 actually. The traffic is noisy but by about 10 pm it all dies down and I slept peacefully every night. <br/>Amenities: I loved the reading lights attached to the headboard, the Keurig coffee maker with an assortment of teas and coffees, the spa package with includes aromatherapy lotions for aching feet and a spritz for your pillow at night. There are many pillows on the bed for comfortable reading and relaxing, as well as two nice chairs and a desk with plugins for your computer. <br/>The double room was extremely clean and modern. The staff was very personal and helpful. <br/>I was a woman traveling alone and felt very safe everywhere I went. <br/>There is a Starbucks attached to the hotel and also a very popular restaurant. They had a great Happy Hour with several nice appetizers and reasonable wines and cocktails. The place is hopping 4-7pm. My service at the restaurant was quite slow during this time, but the service at the hotel was extremely professional.<br/><br/>I walked down to the mall, rented one of the share a ride bicycles for $7, which gave me a full day of privileges. Wherever I stopped, I locked my bike at the nearest station, visited the museum or the monument, then hopped back on the bike to the next location. This is fairly new in DC and there are trails the full length of the mall, around the tidal basin, and around all the monuments. 
158487870	 We didn't get into our usual hotel in DC so had to scramble for an alternative. What a find! For 275/night we stayed in a very well appointed, clean and comfortable King Junior Suite. There is a charge for wi-fi even in the Starbucks in the lobby, but small price to pay. If the convenient Starbucks is not to your taste, Potbelly's, COSI and Corner Bakery are just a block down the street. Easy walk to the Mall or the White House. There were loads of children in the lobby, but didn't hear them running in the halls at all. Very quiet. Great bar/restaurant with outdoor patio facing a park. And all this for half the price we normally pay in DC. Only complaint was that the doormen were rather unconcerned. No help with luggage and let the door hit me as he rushed out in front of me...rather strange for a big hotel. 
158037598	 This is a great hotel to stay for business. Very clean, provides lots of towels, a 24-hr gym, restaurant, starbucks inside, and a lot of seating downstairs in case you need it for a group meeting. Love it. 
121330975	 This hotel is just a block to the McPherson Square metro and an easy walk to the National Mall. Rooms are standard Crowne Plaza, maybe a tad small but it's an historic hotel. Newer flat screen TVs with HD channels was a nice plus.<br/><br/>Parking is high - over $40/night once taxes are added in. You do get in/out service but for folks who are staying in town and not driving for a few days, that adds up quickly.<br/><br/>Wifi is not free, although Priority Members are comped (at least I was when I checked out, but no one alerted me to this when I checked in). 
120839446	 Within walking distance to the National Theatre, White House, etc. The room was just fine even tho it the view was office building windows since we weren't there to be in the room except to sleep. 
120672307	 A nice business hotel. The lobby doesn't smell very good, and the wifi is not free. But the room was nice, with a view of McPherson Square, and one block away from the McPherson Metro station. I had no problems. Very clean. 
120247929	 We recently got married and reserved a block of rooms for our guests at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. Not only is the hotel conveniently located near all of the DC attractions but the staff is outstanding. From the valet who greets you, to the front desk attendants, to the wait staff at the restaurant, everyone we encountered was friendly and extremely willing to help with anything we needed. I would definitely recommend this hotel and my husband &amp; I look forward to returning soon! 
120227310	 This hotel is in serious need of an update. The rooms are small, there is rust on the bathroom fixtures, the furniture is in poor shape, the elevators (that worked) are small. You can hear everything in the hallways (and the room next door). They charge $12.95 for wifi that is spotty. We stayed in a room in the back of the hotel and heard garbage trucks all nights. On the positive side, the exercise room is decent and there is a Starbucks in the lobby. Otherwise, this hotel is no bargain. 
120051314	 A nice hotel in a predominately business area, except for the very loud club down the street. We had a double bedded room that was small by usual American standards, the desk chair had to be moved to the side of the desk to avoid running into it. The bath was small and the tub needed to be replaced. Overall the room was very clean and the front desk personnel were very friendly. The room was either too hot or too cold we couldn't get it right. The continental breakfast was very basic, coffee, bagels, fruit, muffins, orange juice (only), some cereal.<br/>The wifi didn't work in our room (very low signal). I wouldn't stay here again, but the price was right for this visit (I used points). We had a zone 2 visitor parking ticket so we didn't have to pay the $42 parking fee. A decent business hotel, not for families, and I think couples would enjoy a something different. 
8501398	 My son (age 19) and I spent 4 nights here in early August 2007. The big plus was that it was a block away from the McPherson Square stop and so was convenient to everywhere else. Buses run up and down from stops right in front of the hotel. It's just about 10 minutes by bus to the Mall where the museums were. Breakfast was not included witht the room, and bacon and eggs with coffee at the 4K restaurant in the hotel cost $10 per person and it was going to be an extra $3 to have it delivered to the room. It tasted OK but not worth it. The remaining days we found it interesting to cross the street from the hotel, take any bus going towards whichever attraction we were headed to, and stop wherever we saw a decent looking coffee shop on the way. Washington is not like New York where coffee shops abound, but we managed to find suitable places to eat. Across the street from the hotel there is a Subway serving subway sandwiches and pizza and open till 10 p.m.<br/><br/>Our room was clean and so was the bathroom and soaps and little bottles of shampoo and mouthwash were replenished on the third day. Room was cleaned and beds made up daily. No fridge or microwave in the room but an ice bucket was provided and there was an ice-machine on our floor (9th) which had ice almost always, but on one occasion we had to go to the 11th floor to get ice, but it was not a problem. There is an ice machine on every odd number floor. Room was quiet, perhaps because it did not face the street.<br/><br/>The hotel had a free exercise room on the second floor which had treadmills which we used one night. Internet computers were on the floor below the lobby but we thought the price was outrageously high - $9 to log on plus more per minute (I can't remember the exact additional price per minute)<br/><br/>We liked the Hamilton Crowne Plaza and would stay here again.<br/> 
8484364	 My friend and I stayed at the Crown Plaza Hamilton for a weekend get away in June 2007. I must say it was a great location for the price. The rooms were very clean and accommendating. It included a refridgerator which was good to store food for the late nite. Most of the restaurants close early around 10pm.The beds were extra comfortable which made the hotel stay even better. My only compliant would be that the staff was not too friendly. The front desk staff as well the waiters in the hotel restaurant tend to be unattentive. Overall, I would reccommend this hotel to others.<br/> 
8460250	 I typically stay at Sheratons or Westins, so I wasn't sure if this hotel would be a good choice. The value was great (about $139/night in August) and the photos on the Web looked good, so I took a chance. Turns out, the rooms were very clean, modern, and comfortable. They are a bit small, but the beds are nice and the bathroom is well-appointed with marble and modern fixtures. I would definitely stay here again for the price. The hotel offers a free sleep CD, lavender sheet spray, and an eye mask for better sleeping. The hotel restaurant (14K) is delicious, as is DC Coast, across the street. There is a Starbucks in the lobby. Lima Lounge (beside DC Coast) looked very hip with a modern bar and outdoor seating. The hotel is in a perfect location to go there for late night partying. <br/><br/>The lobby and elevators of the hotel are small and simple so it is clear that the hotel isn't for large convention crowds. This means better service!<br/><br/>WiFi costs $10/day and there is no free connection point (like in the lobby), but the Cosi sandwich shop one block away (at 13th and K) has free WiFi when it's open.<br/><br/>The McPherson Square Metro is one block away. Very convenient. Franklin Square (beside the hotel) is host to a lot of homeless people, but I didn't have any problems.<br/> 
8404101	 For a 4 star hotel this was less than stellar. Cleanliness is very important to me and the bathroom had was not very clean. The hotel staff was not very friendly. No concierge available. The restaurant was nice and the staff there were very helpful and friendly. You had to valet park and it was $30 plus tax. On the plus side, it wasn't too far from the White House. I expect more from a 4 star hotel.<br/> 
8366421	 Stayed at the Hamilton with my husband, parents and 2 siblings in early July. The problems started from the off. They managed to locate my husbands and my booking but could only find one of the two rooms booked by my father. The only (and very unhelpful) response from the guy at check-in was &quot;sorry - we have no rooms left - we're fully booked&quot; and he was planning on leaving it like that. This was after a US-based cousin had checked and confirmed all of our bookings the week previously. After much reasonable discussion and explanation, and with no more help forthcoming we requested the manager. And surprise, surprise there actually were rooms available and we all received our respective key cards in record time.<br/>Next problem was locating a porter to transport our bags to our rooms - after the huge delay at check-in we weren't really in the mood for waiting and were late for a reception at that point we took the cart and brought the bags up ourselves.<br/>My room was at the very top of the building and very dark - we needed the lights on constantly. Also it was right under the room where they keep the plant for the air-con so it was very very noisy. We didn't have time to ask to change as we were already late.<br/><br/>Also Europeans beware - breakfast was not included in the room rate as it would be for European hotels and costs $15 for very mediocre fare - no matter how much or little you eat.<br/><br/>The only two redeeming features were: 1) the comfortable beds and 2) the presence of Starbucks on-site.<br/>I will definitely not be staying there again.<br/> 
8282501	 Stayed for 7 nights during a convention. The rooms are very small. The hotel desk staff seem to not really care too much and are not the most helpful when trying to get tourist information (if I remember correctly, the attractions are one of the main reasons people come to DC). In the seven night, our soap was never replaced (we had to use the &quot;face soap&quot; bar).<br/> 
119909041	 We stayed here for a wedding and the staff was wonderful and accommodating. The bartender remembered how I like my martini and the staff allowed us a late check-out even though that is normally reserved for their priority club members and we are not that. The location is very walkable to the Mall and is in an area close to some great restaurants as well. Great DC hotel with comfortable bedrooms as well. 
119799460	 My husband and I stayed here for a weekend on business. We were impressed and will keep this hotel in mind for family travel in the future. <br/><br/>The rooms are nicely decorated and equipped with flat screen tv, in-room safe, coffee maker, iron, and hair dryer. The bed was comfortable, and the Sleep Advantage package - with eye mask, ear plugs, and lavender pillow spray - was a really nice touch!<br/><br/>You can't beat the location: a block away from the McPherson Square metro on the Orange and Blue lines (three stops from Smithsonian and the National Mall), across the street from Franklin Square park, lots of restaurants close by, and within walking distance to the White House.<br/><br/>The hotel's restaurant - 14K - servers breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Its breakfast buffet features hot and cold options for different prices. The array and quality of fruit was impressive! It also has a Starbucks for lighter breakfast fare. 
119479361	 This was awhile back so things may have changed, but I see from current reviews that they are very similar to my experience. It was a good stay. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The beds were really cozy and plush. The standard rooms may have been a little small for some people but suited us just fine. We had a corner room and had a great view of the street scene. The best part of our stay was sitting on the outdoor covered veranda on a warm rainy night enjoying late night coffee and creme brulee and watching the peopleand traffic and talking with my daughter and my husband. The hotel held our baggage after checkout time as we attended a rally until 5 PM and then caught transit to the airport. That was a nice feature. Would stay again. The price is high for our budget but it is in the range of all DC hotels near Capital HIll. 
119267358	 Very nice hotel - staff was very courteous, very clean property. Only issue, as other people have mentioned, was the ridiculously slow internet connection! But otherwise, everything was great. Love the Crowne Plaza sleep kits as well - great feature! 
119184386	 Everyone and everything about this hotel was fantastic! The room was modern, clean and super comfortable and it was overlooking the park and K street (at 14th)! The view was fantastic at night! We ate at the restaurant and that food is still on my mind!- kudo's to the chef! We will stay there again! 
119072352	 Ideal location, courteous staff (ask for Innocent- he knows EVERYTHING there is to know and do in the DC area) and clean rooms. Just know that parking is impossible<br/>In this area! The hotel provides valet though 
156308633	 I stayed here for 4 nights in March of 2013. The room was tidy and pleasant but quite small for the rate, in excess of $200 per night. This could have been due to a conference that was in town nearby. The location is very central and within walking distance of most of the major attractions, including various museums, the Lincoln Memorial and the White House. There aren't many places to eat nearby so if you get the munchies late at night, good luck! It was pretty noisy in the alleyway outside my room at all hours of the night. The The staff was pleasant and the exercise room was excellent with numerous treadmills, bikes and weight machines. Overall, a good experience but the value was only average given the high room rate. 
156198448	 Booked our room on Booking.com for a 4 night stay. After checking in, Kalala did a superb job getting all of our gear and luggage to our room, but we quickly realized it was not the room we had booked. Kalala immediately called the desk and explained the problem and set the wheels in motion to get us a different room. At the front desk Ravi and Lisa explained the online booking sites sometimes use misleading photos of rooms that are not from the hotel being booked The reception desk staff could not have been nicer or more understanding of our situation. Being Easter weekend, all the rooms were occupied. A Special Thanks goes to Ravi and Lisa for salvaging our vacation. <br/>The hotel restaurant, 14 K, served an excellent Easter Brunch. We want to give a special &quot;shout out&quot; to NELSON for taking such good care of us. 
156085409	 Went here for the night after reading reviews of the hotel. Booked through Priceline. Originally requested a pet friendly room which is only the third floor. Then after further reviews I read that lower level floors were noisy. So I left doggy home and called the week before to ask for a room on a higher floor away from elevator. They said they put the notes in the system. <br/>Called a few days before to see if we could request a room with double beds instead of one and was told they were fully booked. Ok no problem. <br/>Arrived in DC at noon. Tried to check in earlier. Couldn't. Ok no problem. Parked the car ($45) left our bags and went for lunch. Came back at 2:30, still no early check in. So we sat at bar and waited 5 minutes before someone walked behind bar. Then asked do you need help? Strange question to ask someone sitting at a bar overlooking a menu. Ok no problem. Went up to desk at 3pm sharp and was told room was still not ready. I said this is a problem. Aside from the fact that a couple walked in without a reservation ahead of me and were offered a room with two beds when I was told numerous times including at noon that they were fully booked. So I mentioned that and she suddenly was able to find a room, with a wait. I said forget, I need a room because we have reservations at the W (hard to get and not worth it see my review for them). She gave me a room. 3:15, she asks me to sign my receipt and circles the price, $135. I said what's that the parking charge? She said yea, no, I said perhaps its someone else's receipt and sure it enough it was. After all that was squared away and I complained (why did I pay $200 and this guy paid $135?) I get our keys, make it to elevator and notice its a third floor room, specifically what I asked a week prior to change. Head back to desk and she apologizes, offers me $100 back on my card for the troubles then gets us into another room on 8th floor. Finally 3:30 and were in elevator to room and i get money back towards the outrageous parking charge. (valet was a mile away according to my mileage, maybe that's why it's so pricey but garage around corner is half price, learned this afterwards)<br/>Room was nice I must say. Beds were smaller but comfy. Decor was nice. View, eh nothing but we sacrificed it for a room on a higher floor. Kuerug coffee maker was nice but only if you pay $5 for water bottle to use it with or just use tap water I guess. Shower was nice and I can't say I heard any noise other than a couple trying to get into the wrong room at 6:30am. <br/>So I go to check out and Mallory is there and says hi so sorry but since you booked through Priceline (she knew this when I checked In) we can't give you a refund. We can offer you parking and breakfast. I said I'd like to speak to your manager. <br/>So over to Joseph I go. I know he is a good manager because always responds to his reviews here so I asked him to make it right. He said he'd try to see if Priceline would allow a refund and after a confirmation with Priceline, boom I get my refund. <br/>So, with all that being said I can say this was a nice hotel, a nice location (walkable to many sites) good lounge, good bell service, and good manager. And I'll book directly with hotel next time since apparently I could have got the room for $70 cheaper that way! 
156020776	 this was done by bidding on priceline so cant comment on price<br/><br/>BUT why do better hotels have to nickel and dime by charging for internet in all the hotel<br/><br/>even the hays adams had free internet in the lobby<br/><br/>besides parking is at the hi end of 42 dollars<br/><br/>BUT other than the dog next door the room was great well maintained and nicely set up<br/><br/>staff are very attentive and helpful<br/><br/>great location for sightseeing 
155995217	 DC is a must visit, and if you can schedule your stay when congress is on holiday you can save big. The Hamilton is a beautiful hotel, close to the subway and the Mall. We were there during some remodeling, but the noise never bothered us a bit. The staff went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable and well looked after.<br/><br/>Fresh squeezed OJ at the attached restaurant went perfectly with a glorious breackfast buffett.<br/>I usually steer clear of ALL buffetts, but this one was so nicely stocked with fresh produce you could tell it was top notch.<br/><br/>I only ranked rooms very good due to their smallish size and the fact that ours didn't come with a built in refrigerator. (the staff did bring up one very quickly BTW, so I'm not complaining)<br/><br/>What really made me rank this stay high was the price I paid (congress was off) for such luxurious accomodations staffed with such friendly and professional people. 
155860835	 Easy access to metro station &amp; just a few blocks away from White House. Front desk people very friendly and made you feel welcomed. Had room over looking the park. Room was warm and inviting, Beds and pillows comfortable, only issue we felt the room could have had better sound proofing from street noise. Excellent breakfast buffet and the staff there were excellent as well. There's a charge to use internet, however, there's a AT&amp;T hot spot signal if you're a customer you can access at no cost which we did. Would stay again but would gladly give up the view of the park for a quieter room. 
2900284	 I decided to fly out an meet my wife after she was in training for a week. Not having been to D.C. in some time, I relied on TripAdvisor and my own judgement and was glad I made the choice of the CP. The lobby was well appointed and the staff friendly. It has the style and character of a hotel its age and has been nicely restored. The king room that we had was very pleasant. While not &quot;spacious&quot; by modern standards, it was very comfortable for the two of us - and I am not a small man. We do not spend tremendous amounts of time in our room anyway, as we want to see the sights when we are visiting. The only real drawback was the constant chatter of police cars as capital caravans ran VIPs around town. If you want to be near the capital area, get used to it. It is omni-present.<br/><br/>The concierge was courteous and helpful, although not extremely inventive. She was able to help point us around to area eateries on a weekend. Not a simple task since the CP is in the financial district (which effectively closes down after dinner and on weekends). The hotel eatery was not four star but was very good nonetheless.<br/><br/>We had a very restful stay and enjoyed the experience. The Crowne Plaza was a great value and I would recommend it.<br/> 
2847804	 Very nice hotel in perfect location. My family (six of us) got 2 connecting rooms. It worked out PERFECT. People's negative reviews of this hotel that I read were pretty pathetic. However, YES the rooms are rather small and so is the bathroom--This was the only downfall.<br/>The beds are very comfortable and everything in the rooms is very classy. The lobby is VERY impressive for a downtown DC hotel.<br/><br/>We had no problems whatsoever with the staff. They were all very helpful. One reviewer was mad because he asked the staff for an umbrella and they told him they sold them in the gift shop, which he thought was rude. Uhhh you want them to just pop a free umbrella out for you behind their desk?<br/><br/>ANYWAYS- the bar/restuarant is very nice but expensive. (My 16 oz beer was $4.50) I got a free valet parking deal with our reservation. They regularly charge $28 a night so you might want to look into finding one too. <br/><br/>We didnt have ANY problems with the noise whatsover. We were here over Thanksgiving so that could be one reason.<br/><br/>We DEFINATELY will stay here next time we come back to DC!<br/><br/>other things to note:<br/>---only get about 17 channels including hbo<br/>---wireless internet in every room but $10/day<br/>---about 3 minute walk to subway<br/>---about 7 minute walk to white house<br/>---computer room in basement lobby<br/>---renovating new fitness room which currently just has treadmill type equipment<br/>---no pool or hot tub<br/>---4 pillows per bed<br/>---coffee pot with free coffee<br/>---cd player/alarm<br/>---thick curtains to let you sleep late<br/> 
2620565	 I got to the Hotel around 3:00 PM and was confused as to where the Valet parking was. It took a while for anyone to come over to help me. Then I tried to check in only to find out that my room wasn't ready yet. No big deal. The bar was open and I decided to help myself to a beer while they had someone clean my room. <br/>When I finally got to my room I was pleasently surprised. The bed was nice and comfy, and the bathroom was nice. Other people are right about the bathroom being a little small, and there really isn't a lot of counter space at all, but I don't need a lot of counter space. The room is on the small side too, but I wasn't planning on spending a lot of time in the room. <br/>Parking was $28.00 per day which was fine because I didn't really see any garages that had a better deal. Although the person that met me there parked on the street for the whole weekend for free. <br/>The Hamilton was close to everything. I spent Friday night, all day Saturday, and Sunday walking. I could barely walk by the time I got home because my legs hurt so much! <br/>Check your bill on the way out because I almost got charged for someone elses drinks at the bar. They had the wrong room number.<br/>They will hold your bags and car up until 5 PM the day you check out for free. <br/>There is almost no nightlife around the Hamilton. One of the bars I went into I was asked if the guy I was with was my pimp... We left. A couple blocks away from that there is a Comedy Club that I highly suggest. <br/>I had a great time down in Washington and I am going back to see everything that I missed. I would stay at the Hamilton again. 
2601156	 My husband and I stayed the night in one of the suites with a king size bed. After walking around the city all day, it was a pure delight to land on the spectacular bed. All the bedding was wonderful, from the numerous pillows to the sylish duvet. The bathroom was full of thick towels and a soft but very large bathrobe. My only complaint; there was only one bar of soap and one little shampoo bottle. The hotel location was ideal for seeing the sights and there were plenty of restaurants and sandwich shops within walking distance. The staff were very courteous and congenial. When we asked for the location of two restaurants, we were provided with a print out of the directions and a map to each location. A lovely hotel.<br/> 
2503394	 We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and were very pleasantly surprised. The location is GREAT!!! Close to the metro and easy to find. The lobby is gorgeous!!! The rooms, although on the smaller side are very nicely decorated and clean. We stayed in a room with a king size bed and it was SO soft and comfortable! During our whole stay there we heard only one siren. The staff was helpful and friendly. Since it was hot and humid when we were in D.C. we just wish this hotel had a pool.<br/> 
2480160	 We booked our reservation online for our first trip (4 nights) to DC, and we were not disappointed in any way! It is a lovely hotel, very clean and well-maintained. Because it is an older building, the room was on the small side, but the furniture, linens and decor were all of good quality and repair; the bathroom was also small but very clean and up to date; the air conditioning was reliable and the beds were VERY comfortable! We took the advice of a previous tripadvisor review and booked a quiet room at the back of the hotel and had no problems with noise at all. We found the staff to be very helpful with directions and suggestions and extremely friendly, particularly Kalala. The hotel automatically upgraded our accommodation, due to a shortage of the type of room we had reserved, and we were able to remain in this room for the duration of our stay at no additional cost. The hotel is within walking distance of The White House; convenient to the Metro; and a short cab ride away from the Capitol and Smithsonian. A number of good restaurants and fast food places are close by. We couldn't have been happier (well, a pool would have been nice for the kids...it was HOT!!!) with our stay in DC!!<br/> 
130017447	 Nice hotel poised for renovations. Great location. Starbucks should pull out or hire staff who knows the drinks. Staff was friendly and helpful. 
129890591	 We were due to be staying at Hamilton Crowne Plaza, Washington DC today May 14 2012. Due to some tragic circumstances we were forced to cancel our trip and cruise. I just want to thank the management of this hotel for the kindness and compassion they have shown to us. We will certainly be recommending and telling all of the kindness shown to us and will be making sure we definitely repay that kindness by rebooking when we are able.<br/><br/>Once again a big thank you and very well done! 
129830802	 I'm from Maryland but stayed at the Crowne Plaza to avoid multiple drives for some events I was attending in DC. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My room was on the 11th floor and had a great city view. Prior to arriving I had read several reviews stating that the hotel was older but my room was really nice and well maintained. The hotel is centrally located with metro access within a block - note that overnight parking is very difficult to find on the weekends ( I had to pay $44 (with fee) for valet). The do have a Starbucks and a restaurant onsite and there are multiple food options in the area. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are headed to DC. 
129608670	 Advantage of this hotel is its location that walkable distance from White House and several National Mall. I think hotel room size will be most appropriate for business traveller and for family with kids, i think the room is quite small. There weren't many choices for breakfast in hotel restaurant and hotel provide vending machine in several floors to purchase cold drinks. In general hotel staff is very informative and helpful for me. <br/> 
129417072	 I got this hotel at a discounted rate and thought it was within walking distance to the National Mall. Well, it is a long walk to the White House which, in turn, was also a long walk to the other memorials. Good there was a Metro Station- McPherson Square near by.<br/><br/>The hotel itself is great and there isn't anything bad that I can say about it except, they should change their key-based, in-room safes to the newer digital ones. The one I had in our room didn't have a key and I was offered to use the safety deposit boxes for free instead. That's good but, nothing beats the convenience of having the safe in-room.<br/><br/>Back to the hotel's location, I have to mention that there really isn't much going on in this area. I was there on a weekend and it seemed dead. But for a Subway, choices for food I thought are limited to pricey bars and restaurants. I did spot a decent chinese place the next block on 14th going north.<br/><br/>Worst is the number of homeless people that litter the area. I think they are drawn to/by the park nearby. It was an issue to me because one, some were displaying noisy, erratic behavior and two, I was with my young kids.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent hotel. The next time I go to D.C. though, I would probably look for a hotel in a better neighborhood with more food options, even if it were farther. D.C. has an excellent metro system and, chances are, the farther hotels will have a metro station nearby. 
129179624	 Regina Willson, Director Sales and Marketing, went out of her way to assist me with a billing issue. The hotel is beautiful and the service we enjoyed met or surpassed all expectations, but it was Regina's personal attention to our requirements that distinguished our visit.<br/><br/>After having attended a conference in the Hamilton Crowne Plaza, a billing error occured on my credit card account. My administrative assistant was unable to rectify the situation, but fortunately I had kept Regina's business card. A quick call to her, a few bits of information relayed, and no problems remain.<br/><br/>Regina demonstrates that the Hamilton really does care about their customers and their satisfaction. I will certainly return, and encourage others to enjoy the same level of personal attention that characterized our visit. 
185684229	 Very god location. Close to the White House. Plenty of good restaurans nearby. Very safe area with a subway station close by too. Around 20 minutes from Reagan Airport in taxi which costs aprox $ 20. Nice bar with goof food as well. 
185508797	 This is an obviously old hotel, but has been maintained in wonderful condition. While the rooms are fairly small (keep in mind the hotel is is downtown DC), they are very well appointed and decorated. The mattress has a very thick pillow top, which makes the bed soft, but immensely comfortable. The windows, however, are pretty small not affording very much of view. However, if your room faces the park, then you get lots of sunshine streaming in in the morning. The bathrooms, although also small, are fantastic. The marble counters, to the mosaic tile in the shower, and the curve shower rob, make the bathroom very pleasant. The shower also has strong water pressure. Of course the room was impeccably clean. I also enjoyed very much having a sofa in the room. 
185412363	 Very attentive staff esp front desk. Bellhop was quick to get a cab and have me on my way as well as carry my bags. <br/>Came back in late in the evening while the front entrance was being polished, and the janitorial staff stopped what he was doing to push the elevator button for me.<br/><br/>Room was extremely comfortable and clean. 
185313853	 We arrived for only one night to this hotel and our stay was great! As we got to DC late, around 10pm we didn't have a chance to eat on our way from NY and the only one negative experience the Hotel's restaurant was closed already. Check in was smooth, the Hotel staff was great and the rooms were absolutely awesome! Nice and comfy beds, new furniture, new carpet, very stylish design. The bathroom had some minor issues though. I wasn't bothered by them at all but the Hotel should've fix it. The bathtub faucet was leaking, so as the sink faucet. <br/>This was my first time in DC and I don't know how the nightlife is around this area but there was a club not too far and a bar called Maddy's pretty close to the hotel. No other late night dining opportunity but pizza. Which you have to make them deliver because the nearest one to the Hotel is closing at 1am. <br/>Besides these minor issues our stay was excellent! 
185232851	 We stayed at The Hamilton recently for our first visit to Washington DC. We were very pleased with our room (up-graded thanks to IHG rewards Club), the friendly and helpful concierge and the location (within walking distance of The Mall and downtown restaurants). After a day of sightseeing we chose to eat in the hotel restaurant and enjoyed the food and service. 
185145108	 We got great prices for over the Friday, Saturday and Sunday. It is clean, good service by the staff and a block from the Metro (DC Subway). Easy to get to from Reagan Airport. Upgrade TV's to Wall Panel HD's. Only short coming they charge for Wifi 
148795962	 My family stayed here two nights over the holidays. The Hamilton filled all of our needs and more. The staff was pleasant when we checked in and out. The hotel lobby is lovely and has kept its historical charm. The rooms are classy and tasteful. My daughter loved the Starbucks on the bottom floor (and the guys working there were really friendly).<br/><br/>There is a Metro station a block away and a CVS less than a block away in the other direction. What more can you ask for convenience? We asked the consierge to help us with a suggestion to see the Va Tech Bowl game and he could not have been more helpful or enthusiastic (thank you!). There is a small but attractive bar by the lobby that my husband and son enjoyed watching a football game late one night. <br/><br/>The room was $119 per night and that was NOT one of those non refundable deals. What a bargan for such a beautiful room in such a good location. I would highly recommend this hotel to someone who wants to stay in a classy hotel with good service, many conveniences, and historical touches. We will remember the Hamilton Crown Plaza the next time we need a hotel in DC. 
148399188	 Just got back from a 2 night 3 day stay with my husband and Two friends. The staff was very polite, friendly, and helpful. The rooms had great decor and were spotless. Great walking distance to restaurants, bars, and attractions. The hotel checked us in early and for check out we were able to leave our car in the hotel garage until 2pm allowing us to explore more of DC while our bags were safely marked in a private room. Great hotel. Would definitely go back!!! 
148353476	 Will stay here again! Very clean ,large rooms!very well decotated with plasma TVs. Lots of windows with a beautiful view if the city.About a $8.00 cab ride to Georgetown... Showed up early for check in they found a room for me and my family and took the time to give me options. Great manager hands on ..think his name was Robby. I come to Dc about 15 times a year. I'll be staying here again. Cool bar downstairs. Good price on drinks and appetizers. Hope this helps with choosing a hotel on your visit to DC. 
148158338	 I was told that many Crowne Plaza have rebranded their hotel and that they are now just one level below the InterContinental in the IHG Hotel Group so I decided to give it a try&amp;see what its like. It did not dissapoint one bit especially this location.<br/><br/>Great lobby as you walk in, there are bellman at the door asking if you need help or need a taxi at all times. The service was very good aswell. The room was nice and can be said as very very nice to fancy. <br/><br/>The location is great, you walk down a block you can get the Metro train or you walk about 15mins and you can see the White House. Someone mentioned the park across the street had many homeless ppl and that is true but I walked by and through the park day&amp;night and was never harmed. Whats amazing is that you see people giving the homeless people food and clothes in the morning in truckloads. <br/><br/>Overall this is a great hotel to stay in and will for sure stay again if coming back to DC. 
147928857	 I stayed here last minute after I got a deal on LivingSocial for an event at the 918 F street location. Rates are competitive, hotel is absolutely beautiful inside and the rooms are spacious and modern. Don't count on necessarily getting a view from the room. It's close to the Blue and Orange line and if you walk 1/4 of a mile to F street, you begin hitting some shops. Staff is great and there's a bar attached to the hotel. <br/><br/>Cons: wifi is $12 a day and parking is $42 if you park for 24 hrs. Be careful of the park across the street, there were definitely homeless people hanging out there the entire time I was there<br/><br/>Otherwise, a great hotel and I'd go back there 
147864472	 I stayed there for the Thanksgiving holiday, and it was a great stay. I got a higher floor (12th Flr), with a lounge just next to the elevator.<br/><br/>I love the ground lobby, and the service was great.<br/><br/>The room that I was given was clean, big and comfortable. I had a view of the building next door, but I do not mind it as I spent my days walking the city. Locationwise, it was good, just a block down the McPhearson station. We could get to the station by taking the blue line from the National airport. <br/><br/>However, I do have to walk next to a small park to get to the hotel. There were a lot of homeless people in that park that time, and I was traveling alone. So I was a bit wary of it. Otherwise, it is a 15-20 mins walk to the White house and the collection of Smithsonian museum. 
202154625	 The hotel was close to all the major attractions and within a very short walking distance to the Metro. The staff was very nice and helpful. I was disappointed with cleanliness of the room, normally I complain but I just didn't want it to ruin my mini-vacation. The glass top by the TV had a glass ring, the headboard had grease marks from someones head (i cleaned it), the bathroom had dust and hair on the floor and floor had drips of something on it. I opted to just clean it myself. The second day the cleaning crew forgot to replace wash rags and the bath mat. <br/><br/>Overall the room was very modern and the styling of the hotel was very charming. Maybe that is what won me over in the end to not complain. The bed was much to be desired, not something that I would have liked to lay on after a long day of walking. <br/><br/>On a side note, I know it was not intentional but the valet left blue pen marks on the leather on my door panel. Which doesn't come off easily, so I was very upset that they didn't take the same care that I do. 
202055281	 Spent 3 nights on Cherry Blossom Festival weekend at the Hamilton. Room was pleasant and quiet--we were facing the inside and not the street. Restaurant appeared pricey for my standards but the hotel is within walking distance of the Country Bakery at the corner of F and 14th, where one could eat for a reasonable cost. A Starbucks is attached to the hotel next door as well. The electronic keys to get into the room seemed to continuously have &quot;issues&quot;...which happens many places and is not exclusive to the Hamilton by any means. Wifi in Lobby. Beds were nice and soft. Ventilation could be controlled or shut off completely for absolute silence. On measure I would return. 
201803524	 The staff was very helpful and the rooms were great. The rooms were nicely decorated and clean, plus the hotel was in a great location. The check in and checkout were very easy and the staff made the check out time flexible to our needs without a problem. The only problem was the club level needs to have a bit better service. 
201709516	 I picked this hotel based on price and TripAdvisor reviews. We had a king room which was comfortable and very nicely decorated. The Staff at the hotel was extremely helpful and we took advantage of the Valet parking. There is plenty to do in the area and even though it's a long walk to the museums, there's so much to look at on the way. I would stay here again next time I'm in DC. 
201475975	 My sister and I stayed her and really enjoyed our stay. The hotel and rooms were cute and comfortable. The best part was the location! We were able to walk everywhere! That made the trip very convenient. I'd definitely stay here again. 
201192757	 Both exterior and interior are a bit dated. There were several projects going on in the interior. They cater to business but rates were still rather high.I was REALLY disappointed with the room.Staff was pleasant 
42667086	 I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for a conference and really enjoyed my stay. I loved the location and the feel of this hotel. The rooms were a very nice surprise because they were spacious and comfortable. The sink space in the bathroom was limited but my colleague's room on the 12th floor had more sink space and she lucked out and had a corner room so the view and natural sunlight from 2 sides was really wonderful. My room's view was of another building but I really enjoyed my stay and the helpful and friendly attitude of the staff there. The restaurant was another big plus because the food and service was excellent and we enjoyed sitting outdoors although there was also indoor seating.<br/><br/>It was great to walk to various restaurants and sights during our stay...we easily walked to Washington Monument, the Capitol, Chinatown, etc. My favorite restaurant was Old Ebbit's Grill and we also enjoyed Las Tasca's ( a tappas restaurant in Chinatown).<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this hotel to everyone, I enjoyed it more than the Grand Hyatt where I stayed last time while in DC. My only complaint would be the noisy trash pick-up in the mornings outside on the street but this is a city so I would definately stay at Hamilton Crowne Plaza my next visit. 
40115103	 My wife and I stayed at the Hamilton for a week. We were able to get a great AAA rate, otherwise I would not reccomend this property. It is convenient to Metro, but on the weekends this area is dead. Not for the casual traveller, better for business travelers.<br/><br/>The building is one of the original DC hotels, so the everything is downsized, elevator, room, closets everything. Do not stay here unless you are able to get a great rate. 
38374912	 My daughter and I stayed at this hotel while checking out colleges in Washington, DC. I think this place is a jewel! Very much like a European boutique hotel with excellent service and very well-kept. The concierege was exceptionally helpful in guiding us toward what sights we should see and when (when we were not visitng schools). We found the room to be very clean, comfortable and elegant. The bar is very nice and inviting and the restaurant is also nice. This place felt more like a 5-star hotel and I think is very good value - and in a great area, as well. The only suggestion I have is to upgrade the TVs from the old &quot;box&quot; versions to the newer flat screens that so many places of this caliber now have. I will definitely stay there again on my next business trip to DC! 
38170525	 This hotel was extremely loud. We were surrounded by rooms full of twenty-somethings who were obviously there party. Clearly, the hotel staff does not enforce the maximum occupancy per room rule. Roudy, young adults were in the hallways partying all night long. The hotel provides one set of ear plugs in each room. Apparently, they are aware of the noise level but choose not to address it. If you want a restful sleep, I do not recommend staying at the Hamilton. 
38093714	 What a find this hotel was. In an excellent position for sightseeing (so close to the White House etc) and with friendly, helpful staff. Our room was old fashioned but well furnished and spotlessly clean. We had robes, slippers, good quality toileteries which were replaced daily and proper mugs with our coffee maker.<br/>The breakfast was excellent value with a vast range of fruit on offer. Meals in the restaurant were reasonably priced and water was filled constantly whilst eating. When we asked about alternative restaurants were were given excellent recommendations.<br/>Even the bar staff were friendly and helpful with drinks very reasonably priced.<br/>All in all you felt that every member of staff actually cared whether or not you had all you needed and our three nights here was an excellent start to our three week trip around the east. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay here again. 
37617922	 This hotel is in a great location if you want to visit the National Mall, the memorials, the capitol, etc. You can walk to the mall in about 10 minutes. There's a Metro subway stop (McPherson Square stop) one block away that will also deliver you to the middle of the Mall (the Smithsonian stop). We were there for 4 days and mostly walked back and forth to the places I mentioned, until the last day when we were more tired and did decide to take the subway. In general using the subway from this hotel is pretty easy - the subway system in DC is the simplest and easiest I've ever seen.<br/>The hotel itself is nice, with a pretty lobby and (not large) but big enough rooms. The bathrooms are small, but nice, except for they don't have fans - or at least our room didn't. This caused the entire room to fog up when we showered, including the mirrors in the room and the window. It wasn't as bad as it sounds, but it's not desirable. Make sure you use the plastic mat that goes in the shower. We didn't have one the first day and both of us almost fell down when stepping into the shower, even though we were trying to be careful.<br/>The front desk staff is polite and fine. I can say I've had nicer staff at hostels. They weren't rude at the Hamilton, they just weren't friendly. The concierge was nice and helpful upon approach and the cleaning staff was very friendly.<br/>The location of the hotel is great for sightseeing, but be aware that there are several nightclubs across the street that get very loud at closing time on the weekend, especially Saturday night. We were on the 9th floor and could very very easily here everything going on in the street at closing time, 3 o'clock in the morning. <br/>All in all, the Hamilton was a decent value. I'd say it's a good location to be close to the usual tourist sites, but if I return to DC, I'll probably stay in another part of town. 
135832225	 First off, the people at check in tried to charge us a higher rate than my confirmation stated. Fortunately, I had my printed confirmation. They were not friendly either. The room was dated, bathroom was too small, and the ac wasn't set right. I had to put the temperature way up so as not to freeze. I would not stay here again. 
135816811	 My fiance and I went to DC for a fun 4 day weekend and stayed at the Hamilton. The staff was fantastic and the location could not be beat. It was close to the metro and yet not too far away to just walk everywhere - we started everyday walking to the sites and by the end of the day jumping on the metro - it is close to great food and bars and yet the rooms are QUIET. The beds are comfy and the bathrooms have enough space for me to spread out everything I need. It was amazing. 
135692722	 I stayed for a week for work, having conferences in the hotels with my employer. Stayed Monday through Friday. Arrived in DC from Montana, and found the heat and humidity overwhelming. When I entered my room I found the AC on and a totally wonderful room that was cool and comfortable. It was like they anticipated my arrival! Room was a little tight on space, but it is a historical building. It was clean, the sheets were wonderful, and I slept like a baby each night after I acclimated to the time change. Yes, my room was on the street, but the noise was accompanied by the ac and did not bother me one bit. This was a great conference hotel, they kept us supplied with ice and water, and a comfortable room to meet in each day. There were chain lunch places close by like Subway, and a few &quot;local&quot; places, like the Lunch Bag. There is also a great Chinese buffet close. I found this to be very centrally located for walking, went on several &quot;DC by Foot&quot; tours and just loved it. Again, coming into a very clean cool room after these excursions out into the heat and humidity was wonderful and heavenly! Never felt the need to get the subway or taxis, I just walked to the things I wanted to see, like the Smithsonian, and the pick-up place at the Old Post Office for the Washington Mall Tour which was great! Got to see it all at minimal expense and the wonderful relief of a very nice clean and cool room at the end. I did use the room service a couple of times, very good food, and fast delivery. I was given a tour of the 3 floors that have been renovated and believe me, my next trip to the city will include a stay at this Hotel. Really enjoyed it. 
135508086	 Medium-sized lobby with lounge chairs. Four elevators. Maps at concierge. Four blocks from METRO orange/blue line, about four from red Line.. Some restaurants nearby, e.g. Brasserie Beck. Lots of taxis and ATMs.<br/><br/>Rooms with poor exterior soundproofing (quiet intra-room) and traffic noise from trucks &amp; busses. No fridge/minibar. Safe in closet (10 hangers). 37&quot; Flatscreen TV with poor channel selection (no SyFy or Comedy Channel), 29 broadcast channels. Signal loss common with summer storms. Alarm radio with CD, headphone audio output, no iPod inputs. Nonfunctional telephone options but wake-up calls from Front Desk OKAY. coffee/tea maker. Steam iron and board, hairdryer..<br/><br/>Comfortable king bed with 4 semi-soft pillows. Tub/shower combo (hot ans warm water only). Tasteful beige and tan patterned wallpaper over brown patterned carpet and white ceilings. Mirrors and tasteful prints. Wooden writing desk at window. No hardwired Internet. WiFi at $12/day. Somewhat noisy A/C unit. Lamps on two bed stands. USA Today newspaper door-side.<br/><br/>$21 breakfast buffet with egg station, pancakes, French Toast, fruits, cereals, yoghurt and great fresh orange juice. Ground level dining room with some outdoor tables along street. Construction activities along street. Quiet bar (no music) with no happy hour. Flying Dog Pale ale at $7/pint. (plus Blue moon and Newcastle). 
134835090	 Centrally located for those visiting the sights in DC, the Hamilton Crowne Plaza has an attentive and very professional staff and one of the best bar-restaurants. <br/><br/>The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished; the bedwas comfortable and (thankfully!) the air conditioning was up to the task in last week's 100' heat.<br/><br/>But what makes this hotel was the happy hour: a great beer selection, plus some awesome appitizers...a cold IPA and an order of the freshest calamari in the city makes the Hamilton Crowne Plaza the place to unwind after a busy day.<br/><br/>In all, a first-class hotel!<br/><br/>PS...but maybe for the cost of the room you throw in free internet access??? 
134745728	 My husband and I stayed June 14-16 and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. It has a historic DC feel, just what you want when visiting Washington. Lovely rooms, updated baths, upscale amenities, wonderful/helpful staff. Shopping, Fords Theatre, and the mall/reflecting pool/Smithsonian were all an easy walk. Close by restaurants to keep costs down if necessary. The food was good, not superb, and it has a terrific gym but lacks a pool. We'll definitely stay again when visiting DC. 
111264964	 I'm a Platinum level member so was upgraded to a nice two room suite which allowed me to work very comfortably. The concierge lounge was well stocked for both evening and breakfast. The location is central to much of DC. 
110627290	 My husband and I just got back from an eight day stay at The Hamilton Crowne Plaza; even before check out we were determined to ensure that we provided a review of this hotel and our experience. <br/><br/>We were able to use our Priority Points to cover our entire stay, and I was a bit concerned about not receiving very good service being a &quot;points&quot; customer. I could not have been more wrong. We were called VIP's by several of the staff, and more importantly, we FELT like VIP's in the way we were treated. This may have been one of the most enjoyable hotel stays we ever had. <br/><br/>The rooms and the facility overall is kept spotless at all times. Our room was a bit small but very nice, really comfortable bed, great shower etc. absolutely on par with other Crowne Plaza locations I've stayed at. The food in the restaurant is wonderful; they have a great head chef! I highly recommend the patio for really nice dining and people watching. The hotel's location can't be beat; just several blocks to the Whitehouse and National Mall, easy access to everything you might need. There are a couple of pretty minor things that could be remedied; the elevators are bit slow, there was no mini fridge in our room, and the key to the room safe was missing (we had access to the front desk safe if needed though) and the cost of the laundry service was too expensive to use. But, as mentioned, considered within the overall experience, these were minor.<br/><br/>What truly makes this hotel stand out, by far, are the staff; they are fantastic! <br/><br/>Our concierge, Innocent (Yoda :)) knows everything about the city, where to go and what to do to make a great trip. He was so warm and so helpful; we'll always remember him. The staff in the restaurant; Melissa and Mary Beth are the friendliest people I've ever met. Sayed and Le, also from the restaurant, are top notch at their jobs and made us feel so at home. Gino in the bar with the ever present smile; made my day by making sure to figure out how to make the perfect Paralyzer LOL! <br/><br/>Those are the names at the top of my mind, but really, I can't say enough about ALL the staff that we interacted with during our stay; security, managers, front desk, cleaning and valets; truly welcoming and wonderful and a team to be proud of. Because of them, we will make sure to recommend this hotel to all of our friends and family traveling to Washington, and will definitely make this our hotel of choice the next time we visit. 
109777090	 Stayed here for a week, from a Thursday to a Thursday. Staff were exceptionally inept and rude. The norm was to charge 4 dollars for a mineral and bar staff just keep the 6dollars change as their tip!! Restaurant food was beautiful, however VERY overpriced. Had a room with a view of the adjacent park, paid extra for this (320dollars a night) assuming it would be a pleasant view. The website neglected to mention this park is full of homeless people who will keep you up all night. The location is central and close to the White house and alot of the attractions. However I would have preferred to stay further away and got a metro. This hotel ruined my experience of DC, I didnt feel welcome there, nor comfortable there. The rooms are also very small compared to hotels in the area. I will never go there again nor recommend it to anyone!! 
107991282	 Great location for 1st time in DC tourist;good value for money;great little extras offered priority club members;fabulous restaurant with outdoor verandah offering views of the park and the quirky things you see in a city;didn't eat anywhere else;wonderful staff;minor niggle: no fridge but this may be the norm in the US(we are from Australia) 
106532003	 I selected this hotel for the price and the location. They have a unique feature called the Women's Floor for single business travelers which is located on a key actived floor and has great amenities such as a robe, eye mask, scented linen spray, etc. The hotel is beautiful on the outside and unlike other older DC hotels, has room to move in guestroom. It was cleaned to perfection each day of my stay. The beds are firm and they offer feather pillows as well as standard pillows. The hotel offers room service and restaurant on site (which is a must for dinner or breakfast!). Staff is very professional. 
105058567	 Great location. Close to the major sights. Clean rooms and lobby. Attentive staff. Great meal in their restaurant. Very slow car valet service. Had a room on the 10th floor overlooking a park and half the Washington Monument. Nice!<br/>This is a large city so know where you are walking at night. 
8245931	 Stayed from July 21-26th. I got lucky and had a double bed corner room on the 6th floor, it wasn't entirely spacious, but comfortable enough for two people. Lobby is great, elevators worked fine, and the workout room was much better than I was expecting. There are about 4 treadmills, 3 ellipticals, 3 bikes, freeweights, and a few weight machines. The cardio equipment is linked to satellite TV, so you can watch tv while working out. <br/><br/>I have visited DC many times, previously staying at the Doubletree Suites, The Watergate, and the GWU Inn, all located in Foggy Bottom. Because I wanted to try a different location and because the Crowne Plaza was the cheapest I could find ($122/night using AAA), I couldn't pass up staying there. The staff was very friendly, rooms are comfy with a very nice bathroom. The only negative I have is the fact that it's a little noisy - which is expected when you stay anywhere downtown. It wasn't a big problem, I wore earplugs (which they give you in your sleep package) and I slept fine. <br/><br/>I have read negative reviews about the park across the street, which is nice in the daytime, but frequented by homeless people at night. It's not a big problem, nobody bothers you. The area near the hotel is all businesses, and no, it is not deserted at night. It is a safe area, there are always people walking around, even at nighttime. There is a CVS located about two blocks away at 15 and I street. But the great thing about its location is that it's only one block away from the Metro and it's centrally located - restaurants and other Metro stops are within a few blocks (within walking distance, in my opinion)<br/><br/>The hotel location, price, and the customer service made for a nice stay. The next time I come back to DC, I will definitely stay here again.<br/> 
8111230	 My husband, son and I stayed 5 nights for a convention. We picked the<br/>Hamilton because it was near the convention center and took dogs. The<br/>hotel staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious at every meal. I dont know if they gave us an extra small room because we were on the &quot;dog floor&quot; but we are priority club members, have stayed at a lot of crown plazas and this was the smallest room/<br/>bathroom we've ever had. That being said, the location was perfect and I took my dog for a walk to the White House every morning!<br/> 
8097029	 The rooms were small, but clean and comfortable. Our door was quirky - had to use the key and give some &quot;hip&quot; at least five times before the door would open. The staff was friendly although many did not seem to understand English. The concierge was not very helpful about where places were located. We were looking for the corner bakery and went on a four block hike following his directions. It turned out the corner bakery was one block down the street on K! The restaurant downstairs served good food, but the menu was limited as was seating unless guests arrived well before the standard dinner hour. Starbucks in the hotel stocks a limited number of pastry items, and they run out early! If you sleep until mid-morning, you are out of luck!<br/><br/>Overall, the Crowne Plaza was a great place to stay. We felt safe and comfortable. We had no problems with the water being hot; the faucets have an unusual turn to get hot/cold water and probably many guests don't know how to use them properly. The hotel provided CD playersand a sleep CD. There is noise all night long in the city (especially on weekends) and the sound CD helped to shut that out so sleeping was peaceful.<br/> 
8041441	 This hotel was a great find - cheap and with a central location. It is very easy to walk to all of the major sites, and it is nice and clean inside. Nice big beds and bathrooms - all you could want in a hotel. The restaurant downstairs is average - the first time we went there, the food was great, the second time, the service was a little poor. No breakfast included, but there are plenty of breakfast places around, and even a Starbucks attached - though we never saw it open!<br/> 
7968369	 Stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza from 6/19 - 6/21 and was very pleased overall. The staff was very friendly, which more than made up for a few shortcomings (check in delayed a few minutes to find a clean room at 6PM, quirkly room door took repeated attempts to open and the shower water was warm but not really hot in the AM). Got a decent rate (over $200 but way less than $300) mid-week.<br/><br/>For a hotel with 300+ rooms, it felt much like a much smaller hotel....which I like versus the larger DC Hotels. And, since it's only one block from the Metro station, getting to the Smithsonian/Mall takes only 10 minutes total. 14K restaurant, located in the lobby, was great.<br/><br/>Would stay here again.<br/> 
7753380	 The hotel was beautiful, the service and price we paid was excellent. The quality of the fruit on the breakfast buffet was way beyond the standard fare and the coffee was delicious.<br/> 
133860440	 The hotel is very big and the food was good, This is not a cheap hotel but the saying is you pay for what you get. It has a covered parking garage which was nice for my motorcycle since I am a Rolling Thunder member and about a hundred or so of us stayed and not one complaint. Thanks Staff. 
133362898	 I am a Platinum Rewards member with an advance confirmed reservation &amp; upon arrival they still did not have a room available for me. I was kept waiting 30 minutes while they tried to find an available room and it was NOT the room type I had paid for. I contacted management to give them the opportunity to correct the situation, they did not care...their attitude was that I was lucky they found me a room. Paid for an upgraded Executive King with a Park view. I received a dusty, moldy, cramped room in the back with an alley view and A/C that did not work. Windows are single pane glass on a busy street, so it is impossible to get a good night's sleep. The entire staff (with the exception of housekeeping) had a bad attitude and did not act like they knew anything about customer service. I would have shrugged it off had I paid $99/night, but I was paying $399 per night for this horrible treatment. I did not receive any of the Platinum benefits per my membership status. They billed me $12.95/day for internet when it should have been free for Platinum members. I should have paid attention to the poor reviews. The location is amazing, but there are plenty of other hotels in the area to stay at. 
133190048	 I stayed at this hotel as part of a conference and was there for two nights. Wasn't very impressed with the hotel overall - first off, for the price, the hotel does not live up to expected standards. Things in the room were dated, old, the panel was falling off the air conditioner which meant dust would blow out all day/night. The room was pretty dark and not very big. The lobby smells like mold and the rooms like mildew. Beds comfortable and bathrooms nice.<br/><br/>There is internet (you have to pay per device, per day, though I argued this at check out and they did give me a discounted rate) which is very fast. The gym is extremely small but has the basic machines if you just want to get in a quick workout. I'm pretty sure it's open 24 hours. <br/><br/>Pretty good location - not far from other things we needed to get to in the city. <br/><br/>Overall, I found the hotel to be pretty run down and dated. This would not have usually been an issue, but for the price, I really felt it was not up to expected standards. 
132706175	 If i could describe this hotel in three words it would be: smelly, outdated and dirty! When you first walk into the hotel it smells like it has never been cleaned. Just very old and dusty. The rooms are extremely small and outdated in terms of design. The beds are very uncomfortable and the sheets kept me up all night itching, which leads me to believe they were not changed. The towels had stains all over them. I'm not sure why there was a radio with a cd player in the room, its 2012 who uses cds anymore? And on top of everything else i got an eerie feeling the entire time i stayed in our room. The service was horrendous, when we first arrived we were given a room that wasnt even the suite we asked for. On top of that the air was broken. <br/><br/>The only good thing about the hotel is the fact that there is a starbucks in it and its location. Everything else is gross. Save your time and money. 
132701104	 I stayed at this hotel in June 2012 as it was the hotel of choice for a conference I was attending. Looking at prices, it is good value compare to other hotels in the area. <br/><br/>With one day off to explore DC, I found the location of this hotel ideal by foot, taxi cab and the subway which was very close to the hotel. The white house is only a couple of blocks away and the national mall is a nice walk away. Starbucks is situated in the hotel along with an ATM machine (that works!).<br/><br/>I personally loved the antique feel of this hotel. Beds &amp; pillows very comfortable and bathroom amenities were great. Room was spacious enough for myself and 4 big bags.<br/><br/>With exception of one man at reception on the morning of June 9th, I found all other reception staff to be straight faced and abrupt. The woman at concierge was incredibly knowledgeable and provided clear instructions and maps on my desired locations. She was truly fantastic!<br/><br/>Restaurant: Ate breakfast and dinner for 6 nights. Maitre d' was always efficient however not much could be said for the table service on any of those days. Food was delicious, good selection and good value which is why I kept going back.<br/><br/>There is no free wifi at the hotel which was disappointing given the other 3 hotels I'd stayed in on this trip through the USA all had complimentary Wifi.<br/><br/>Special thanks to: The housekeeping lady on the 7th floor was a wonderfully friendly lady, Cori at the bar and the lady at concierge all should be commended by management for their outstanding service.<br/> <br/>I would certainly stay here again simply because of the above named staff, value for money and location. 
132616277	 The location is great, all the staff very nice and friendly, clean but small rooms. The hotel itself is old but well taken care of (I hear they are getting ready to remodel soon) No contintal breakfast, no pool... But I understand this is the norm for DC 
178473379	 This is a great place to stay if you're going to Washington, D.C. Close to the White House and about a 5 block walk down to the Willard Hotel to pick up the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus. You can buy your tickets right there in front of the Willard.<br/>We got the breakfast plan with our room, and that was well worth it. Lovely buffet, great personal service. They had run out of French Toast but they insisted on making some more especially for my husband. The outdoor seating area was a pleasant place for dinner(we had the pork chop dinner and it was marvelous! Yum!!). Service was good in the bar as well. Nice place to watch the world go by with a good glass of wine.<br/>We had a room facing Franklin Square Park (extra charge for this). I'm not sure if I'd recommend overlooking the park. At night, that particular corner of K &amp; 14th Streets was very congested with traffic and there was a lot of car/taxi honking. The park isn't really that scenic or pretty to gaze upon from the 9th floor. All hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The rooms are somewhat smaller since this is an older, historic hotel. Elevators only hold 8. Rooms were clean, beds comfortable. I'd stay here the next time I came into town. 
178408310	 Just spent the weekend at this hotel and was very pleased. It's in the White House area and a block away from a metro station. The room was a good size and very clean. Did not eat in the restaurant but it looked inviting and would have if my stay was longer. Having drinks at the bar was enjoyable. I will definitely return to this hotel for future DC trips. 
178326732	 I spent 5 nights at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza a couple of weeks ago. It is at a good location, near both the Metro and a Capital Bike Share site, so it's easy to get to anywhere in the city. It's also close enough to be able to easily walk to the White House, or a bit further to the National Mall or downtown. My room was very comfortable, and I really appreciated having a bath so I could relax my feet after too much walking around the city!<br/>But the expensive wi-fi did annoy me, even more so that you even had to pay to use it in the foyer (I didn't and got my wi-fi elsewhere).<br/>I was also surprised that they wanted $5 for the bottle of water in the room, which I thought was pretty expensive.<br/>I should confess that I reduced the cost of my stay here by using Holiday Inn points (as it is a member of the Intercontinental Group).<br/>So a very nice hotel, but the extras aren't cheap! 
177846606	 MY husband and I stayed here in the spring and then we just stayed here again with my sister and BIL. We enjoy this hotel - its very nice, has a nice bar with pretty good food, and best of all has a great location. Its close to many things and only a couple blocks to the metro. The first stay we were upgraded to a suite, which was spacious and gorgeous. The second stay we had a smaller suite with a foldout couch and while much smaller, it was still very nice. The staff is always very friendly as well. 
177794799	 Excellent location for sightseeing being 1 block from metro. Staff are extremely courteous and accomodating. Enjoyed buffet breakfast each morning with added bonus of reduced rate due to being IHG members. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel. 
177775486	 We loved our room at the Hamilton! We looked right over the park and the clock on the building across from that. A bit noisy but that's the city.... We were there the day of the shooting so there were more sirens than usual. Very disturbing.<br/><br/>The breakfast was awesome. Good coffee too.... sad to be charged $12.95 per day per device for the internet. That seems a bit ridiculous for a hotel of this standing. Just saying... <br/><br/>Mmmm. The linen was the BEST. 
150530224	 I found this hotel on Priceline and booked it because it was the least expensive for the location. <br/>I stayed here for one night during the inauguration and it was the best decision I made. <br/>I flew into IAD because DCA was sold out and I thought it was going to be a pain to get into DC but it wasn't. The Hamilton. Is just one block away from metro station. <br/>The hotel itself is in the perfect location for all the sight seeing there is to do in DC. It's a clean hotel and the staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. Considering its location and the fact that I was in the 2nd floor it was quiet.<br/>I had to pay for Internet, which was 12.95 a day. <br/>One thing I didn't like we're the bath products or the fact that the shower drained really slowly. I do not like standing in my own filth while showering. <br/>I would def stay here again if I was visiting DC again. 
150432664	 I'm blown away by the customer service provided by the hotel staff. The location is perfect, but this hotel's strength is its people! The bar makes a great pomegranate martini, food is excellent, rooms are well kept. I will stay here again, and I definitely recommend this hotel! 
150042371	 I often travel to DC and this trip made enough of an impact to post. I normally stay at the Hamilton when I come to the area but with my most recent travels it ensured I will never stay anywhere else. The Director of Guest Services, Nicole was at the desk while I checked in and saw that I worked for a hospital network based in Minneapolis. She easily was able to speak of the work I do in the Minnesota area with great knowledge and actually thanked me for all of the research I do day in and day out, This research is the reason I travel to DC often. The simple act of thanking me was enough to make my day and make a difference in my travelling experience. Nicole never indicated she was the manager of the area but it was apparent in the overall presense she carried and how she interacted with staff whenever I walked through the lobby. I asked a team member who she was and they said happily &quot;She is my new Manager&quot; now not often do team members seem so happy like I experienced. Kudos to the new addition, clearly an impact has been made with the staff as well. Excellent location, excellent rooms, excellent staff, love the 14K restaurant as well. 
149815139	 Although I have stayed at this property on several occasions through the years, this is my first review. This historic hotel is located at 14th &amp; I, a short distance from many major attractions.<br/>The nearest Metro stop - McPherson Square - is only a block away. My room was well-appointed and very clean. The staff is attentive and very friendly. Two different reception clerks actually greeted me by name as I departed for the day and upon my return over the course of my three day stay. The hotel offers its own little restaurant and bar called 14 Karat. There is also a Starbucks shop on the premises. Across the street is Washington's popular DC Coast restaurant. 
149607952	 LOCATION<br/>This hotel kind of ticks all the boxes. I was there on holidays for a couple of nights to see the sights of Washington DC on my way to Miami, but I would be very happy with this hotel if I had have been travelling for business also. Very easy walk to the Washington Monument, the White House and a longer more athletic walk to the Capital, but a great walk nonetheless. Lots of cabs and busses nearby. Not that many places to eat in the immediate vicinity but Dupont Circle is very near in a short taxi ride and has many many places!<br/><br/>SERVICE:<br/>The service wasn't standout, but it was sufficient. The team could be a little friendlier and less 'operational and process driven'. But don't get me wrong, I didn't have a bad experience with them at all, this is just a small tip for the General Manager. I manage 11 hotels in Sydney and I understand that customer service is a very challenging area to ace.<br/><br/>ROOMS:<br/>The rooms are small but very well appointed, stunning actually. The bathrooms are very clean and a comfortable size. It's a very standard good hotel with nothing out of the ordinary but nothing to fault.<br/><br/>RESTAURANT/ROOM SERVICE:<br/>We got room service one night because we were lazy and watching a movie. It was fantastic, very good quality for room service! In Sydney room service is shocking, so I was very happy, and not too expensive either. I had a cocktail in the bar one night with my partner and it was good, not incredible thought. Also, the bar staff kept talking between themselves about their shifts and what days they had off etc.... I wanted to stay and have a few more drinks but the vibe wasn't right with the staff more concerned with each other than the customer, so we left and went to our room. We had breakfast the final morning and the buffet was fantastic, but a bit pricey.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this hotel to tourists and business travellers. 
149293999	 We stayed here for four nights in a park view room. It was a light and sunny room and very comfortable. Easy walking distance to many attractions and shopping area. I have noticed that other contributors have mentioned the homeless people in the park, but I did not feel nervous at all when walking through or past the park. Our group of six had dinner at the hotel restaurant twice and really enjoyed it. Make sure you try the chocolate tower - it is delicious! 
236573164	 Staff all super nice, and tons of places to walk to. Very convenient. If you're an IHG Rewards member the Wi-Fi is free! Parking is $45 or so per night, but you can easily use SpotHero or another parking app to find parking very close at half the cost. 
236566228	 I was really impressed with the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. I was surprised at the size of the room and the bathroom. The location is one block from the metro and there are lots of attractions and restaurants within walking distance. Parking is $45/night but it's DC so to be expected. 
236555554	 we stayed here in July this year (i know this review is late!) with my son and his girlfriend - we had a suite that would accomodate us with sliding doors that made two separate rooms. The room was really comfortable and nit was nice to have an in room coffee maker - not something that all higher end hotels will provide.<br/>The staff were always friendly and the bar food was great. The world cup was on whilst we were there and the atmosphere was brilliant - even the waiters dressed up to support their teams!<br/>Easy walking distance to the White House and most major attractions although we did get a few blisters from all the walking we did - overall a fab hotel that I would use again and reccomend to others! 
236120245	 Great location to walk about and see sites. Room comfortable and quiet. Does not have feeling of chain hotel. Great front desk and bell staff. Good place for meeting as wait staff accommodating. Nice to have Starbucks option in hotel and good restaurants in walking distance. Will definitely stay here again. 
236095402	 This hotel was very lovely room size was adequate the bed was Devine very clean and quite , location was fine easy walk to many places , the staff were extremely helpful restaurant great .<br/>Recommend ! 
235873219	 Staff were friendly, accommodating and efficient. they went the extra mile to help out when I arrived late and needed to get some documents printed quickly for a meeting. The room was clean and comfortable and location was accessible to public transit. A great find. 
187844769	 The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, and made me feel like a valued guest throughout my 3-night stay. The location is prime, with proximity to the Metro. Room appointments and decor added to my enjoyable stay. 
187843939	 Lived the restaurant 14k. Delicious food and great service. One of the best restaurants we ate at the entire week. The Wi-Fi was terrible. Barely got a signal. However the room was gorgeous and bed very comfortable. The location is close to everything and a great location. Definitely will stay at again. 
187827424	 Recently stayed here for 2 weeks for training and the only positive I really have to say is that the decor in my room was nice. Room faced McPherson park where a lot of homeless slept at night. It is extremely noisy (woke up in the middle of the night on several occassions), hotel charges for internet ($13 per day per device), which is ridiculous considering all other hotels offer complimentary wireless internet. After speaking with the front desk and informing them that I was under the impression when booking that it came with complimentary wireless internet, they gave me an internet coupon code to enter but the internet was still extremely dissappointing. Internet cut in and out THROUGHOUT my time using it so I stopped and used my cell phone to do all my research and checked mail. Laundry cost a fortune (which I expected) that I decided to take it to a laundromat approximately a 10 minute walk away. I would recommend the Hilton Garden Inn approximately 1 block away If you want to stay in a nice hotel with more ammenities, such as, complimentary breakfast, complimentary wireless internet, coin operated laundry available on site, and close proximity to the metro station (literally located right across from McPherson Metro Station!) 
187799778	 We stayed one night at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza on a recent weekend trip to DC. It was a great hotel for our needs. Since we were attending a wedding, we did not explore the area much.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>- very comfy bed<br/>- good shower<br/>- room was a great temperature, and with windows you can open<br/>- card-required for elevator to rooms felt extra secure<br/>- very polite and friendly staff at desk<br/>- room felt up-to-date and clean<br/>- nice TV<br/>- no noise complaints/issues<br/>- Starbucks shop off the lobby made it very easy to get quick and good quality coffee in morning.<br/>- Lots of nearby sandwich and lunch spots.<br/>- Speedy check in/check out.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Parking is tricky. Either pay for overnight in garage lot on other side of block ($27) or street parking at meter or pay for valet.<br/>- No view from our room - all we saw was building next door, so had to keep blinds drawn for privacy the entire time. 
187474247	 What a seldom delight... windows one can open (a bit) in the US. And downtown Washington is so dull the street noise is very limited.<br/>Beautiful hotel at excellent Location. Has a great character. Very friendly staff... in raw quantities.<br/><br/>Bing downside is paid Internet. Just stop that nonsense. Live up to your Standard.<br/><br/>Breakfast is very exspensive. Probably also because of many staff. Good alternative: the inhouse Starbucks.<br/><br/>If the Hamilton would offer free Internet, it would be my Washington adress. 
187458361	 I visited Washington DC last week since I had a meeting and had a very good experience in this hotel. Everyone was very kind, especially Elizabeth at the front desk and Kalala the concierge. Small hotel but very well located, near the bus station, near the Convention Center. Confortable rooms, beds. Small gym but enough to have a good workout. It's restaurant very good but a little expensive. I definitely recommend it 
86057586	 This was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had. I have stayed here before and had friends stay her and had a pleasant stay but the hotel has really gone downhill. There are several night clubs in the area with valet parking - people honk to try to park, well we heard honking and whistles of the valets until 5am, it was terrible. Either get sound proof windows or work with the local police department to stop this illegal noise, no excuse. On top of that the fire alarm went off at 4am and stopped a few minutes later, no word from anyone at the hotel what we should actually do. Turns out all of the elevators shut down so when we tried to leave at 8 am we had to wait 20 minutes for an elevator. I called the front desk and said &quot;Do you realize the elevators are broken?&quot; She said &quot;All of them?&quot; She did not apologize or explain what happened. It was like talking to a rude cashier at a fast food restaurant. When we returned to the hotel at 4pm the elevators were still broken and no one from the hotel was there to assist the mass of people waiting for 1 elevator. This is what you expect in the ghetto projects not a hotel. The hotel is in a good location and does have nice rooms and facilities but I will not stay here again. 
85654096	 We were very pleased with the Hamilton. Decor was very attractive and comfortable, service excellent. Metro station in next block or can walk to the Mall or White House if you're a walker. Had dinner in the hotel restaurant one night and were pleasantly surprised to find both the food and the service outstanding. I scouted the Internet for hotels in the heart of the city and this one had good rates without sacrificing quality or location. It lived up to our expectations and more. It's on list of National Historic Hotels. 
85630334	 The room was not very nice. Lots of little problems that added up. Hair in tub. Holes in towels. Old mattress. Sheets didn't fit bed. Used lotion from previous guest left in bath. Light bulb burnt out. <br/>I found the room to be oddly decorated. The artwork was generic. Monkey print on the shower curtain. Italian words on the curtains. Funky ottoman. Can someone tell me what the letters on the lamp mean? Is it nautical? Another different print on the bed skirts. <br/>There was a nice TV.<br/>The location was kind of close to the tourist sites, but in a boring neighborhood. Maybe it is good for those on business? Lots of homeless people reside in the park across the street. <br/>The lobby was attractive in the same odd style of the hotel rooms.<br/>I didn't eat at the 14 K restaurant. Siroc, an area restaurant recommended by a front desk agent, was nothing special.<br/>I usually like historic hotels, but this one disappointed. 
85500188	 Checked in with ease. Informed that we had received an upgrade due to husband's Priority status. Our room was clean but tiny and located directly in front of the elevators on the 14th floor. Toilet dripped constantly and the heater made a dripping sound each time it kicked on. Evacuated room at 3am the first night due to a &quot;false alarm&quot;. While this was no fault of the hotel, we were surpised at the disinterested attitudes of the staff as well as the lack of information provided. Elevators (4 total) were in various states of working order throughout our stay, resulting in difficulties going up and down to and from our room. By the afternoon of the second day we had to request another room due to constant disruptions outside elevators (and our room). Front desk staff were rude when approached with concerns, including lack of water in all vending machines. We were disappointed with the overall experience since we are usually happy at Crowne Plazas. While the hotel is in a great location, so are several others. We will try them next time. 
85490045	 Stayed here the night before the Rally to Restore Sanity. Convenient, friendly, nicely appointed. Very comfortable beds. Great happy hour. Breakfast was hectic but a great deal for Priority Card members. Would definitely stay here again. 
85481225	 I stayed at the Crowne Plaza for the American Library Association Annual Conference. I had read reviews that said the hotel was nice and I must agree. The staff was friendly, room service was good and the restaurant breakfast was very very good. The only downside was the concierge service, it was pretty non existent. I had asked a question about one of the museums and they gave me incorrect information. Other than that the room was perfect for me and my partner. Our room overlooked the park and included a king size bed that was very comfortable. Our air conditioner was not working at first but they fixed that immediately, which was nice. As far as location, it was walking distance to the white house and within a block or two to the subway which was very convenient. Just be ready for a lot of walking when visiting Washington DC and drink plenty of water. I didn't drink enough water and returned to Tucson with sever dehydration, so don't make the same mistake I did. Anyways, I would highly recommend this hotel. 
127313409	 The hotel is about a half mile walk from the Mall which is very doable. They have valet parking, but we thought it would be easier to walk to things as parking around the Mall is difficult. The hotel lobby has a full-service Starbucks! That was a definite plus for us. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. 
126985484	 The Hamilton is an older hotel so the rooms are a little dated but very comfortable. It did appear during my recent stay, however, that they were preparing to remodel as there were 4 different room designs on display in the lobby. The Hamilton is conveniently located and in a walkable mixed use (business, commercial, government &amp; residential) area. They are clearly trying to create a niche catering to the needs of women travelers with a deisgnated keyed-access women's floor with special in-room amenities and a women's networking dinner nightly that's pefect for women traveling solo. The Hamilton's bar 14K has a happy hour with good drink discounts and an really great gourmet bar menu with prices that would be hard to beat. I'd definitely stay here again on my next trip to D.C. 
126942787	 Highlights are friendly staff and the Starbucks that is located right off the lobby. Unfortunately, the lobby smells of mildew and with my allergies, my first night was tough, the room was musty. I had a room with double beds, the first bed I tried to sleep on had no springs (old), fortunately the second bed wasn't as used. I think the hotel is supposed to be renovated, I would wait until the renovation before staying there again. Bathrooms are small and I hope they put in new tubs. Location is very convenient. 
126916877	 Lovely location overlooking Macpherson Square. Close to D.C. visitor attactions and good shopping and dinning. Hotel is in good condition. Suite I received was very clean and well appointed. Lounge area was nice with good items in the evening and a reasonable continental breakfast. Staff were all agreeable and professional. 
126653275	 This was a really nice hotel and we liked being close to everything near the downtown. Why, thought do they cheap it on the wifi? I just don't get why expensive hotels don't do free wifi when a Best Western can do that. Even the lobby was a fee and they make Starbucks charge too. Just silly. 
126549892	 Wonderful location in Washington, however, the park across the street just teems with the homeless. Only one block to Metrorail and several restaurants nearby, but since it's right downtown, not noisy at night. 
179150816	 Great location if your sight seeing in Washington very well positioned for main sights.The food in the hotel was reasonably priced the bedrooms very good and staff extremely helpful at all times a special mention for the concierge who managed to get our party a table at the Chop House review to follow.The only draw backs to the hotel from my view was the parking which I suppose is the same for all City Centre hotels and the noise,our bedroom was positioned on the side of the hotel facing the park and there is a night club just up the road the noise is all night long.Having had little moan I would stay there again yes,but I would make sure the bed room was on the our side of the hotel. 
179093466	 We recently stayed here with my sister and brother in law when we were in town on a motorcycle trip. The hotel is very nice and they offer a valet parking garage which was a great option for us to park our bikes and not have to worry about them while utilizing the metro instead of navigating traffic on a motorcycle. The bar was nice and while we didn't eat there, the drinks were very good! We split a room, it was small but very, very nice! The only thing I could knock it on might be the pull out of bed that was in our room, it could def use a new mattress but it is livable! We took turns as we were there for 2 nights and the regular bed was amazing!!! The hotel also has a great location to use the metro! 
179000520	 I stayed here for a few nights last week. I have to admit that I didn't choose the hotel as my stay was arranged by the organization hosting me but I was really quite impressed. As you might expect from an historic property, the rooms are on the small side but nicely appointed. Beds were comfortable and the rooms were quite clean. Windows had roll down screens which provided privacy and yet let in light; an additional layer of curtains blocks out the rest of the light making a really nice dark room for sleep. <br/><br/>I was given a corner room right on the intersection of K &amp; 14th and enjoyed the view up and down the streets. I read in other reviews that the corner could be quite noisy and I have to say that they're right - not deafening and the windows kept out most of the sound but I was surprised that nights were noisier than the days. It's not a reason not to stay here, but if you are noise sensitive, you may want to forego the view and opt for a quieter room on the side. <br/><br/>The location is really terrific and in addition to the McPherson Square Metro Station, there are many buses that run up and down 14th and, my personal favorite, the Circulator, gets you to Georgetown with almost no stops for a buck. This hotel's great for a lot of reasons and worth a look! 
178886900	 The Hamilton Crowne Plaza in Washington is in a great location, just round the corner from the White House. Room was fine and staff helpful but must admit that I cannot understand why some limited free wifi cannot be offered to guests. It seems to be the main negative comment about this hotel so why don't customer services for Crowne Plaza listen to feedback to avoid this? 12.95 dollars for every 24 hours of access when just needing to check and send a few emails is far too expensive and together with a 5 dollar price tag on a bottle of water in the room does not give a good impression of this establishment which is a pity as, apart from the wifi, it was a good place to stay. 
178722886	 In the middle of everything. Great location, however it is a shame that they do not have a swimming pool. For a hotel like this you would expect to have such facility. Rooms are small but functional. Good service from the front desk and the housekeeping. 
178577485	 My best friend is getting married in December and we wanted to have her bachelorette party in DC. We wanted this hotel for two rooms both for one night. We called the hotel at 6:30 pm on a Monday night and were unknowingly transferred to an 800 number. With 6 calls made between the other maid of honor and I, and 3 hours later we had managed to book 2 rooms and ultimately have them cancelled upon no request of our own. We received more information that we needed to contact direct sales between 8 and 5. With 3 more phone calls and two messages later, I have yet to speak to someone about booking these rooms. The staff at the front desk were not helpful at all. When I told them we were just going to look for another hotel, they did not even try to accommodate us or find someone we could speak to immediately. Trying to book this hotel was a DISASTER!!! 
16340453	 Hotel was fine. It was difficult to see how/where to park (no signs), but eventually found out everything is valet and baggage handlers. Those individuals were professional and courteous, but each touch is another few dollars. Parking was expensive ($33.60/day plus tip). My room was adequate for a two night business traveler, but it seemed very small, hidden behind the elevator, with a view of an office building. I was walking distance to the Washington Convention Center, so I met my objective for staying at this hotel. 
15816322	 We stayed here on an overnight weekend trip to DC. The valet service was very convenient upon arrival. The lobby kind of smelled like salt water (like the ocean) I think a little bit, but maybe it was just some cleaning product or something, who knows. The room was a steal given the great deal we found online. The room was small, but it was very clean. I am a stickler about hotel water pressure, and the water pressure in the shower was great! Also, the location is amazing--we were able to walk downtown and to the historic areas with no problem. We also had dessert in the hotel bar/restaurant--the service was a little lacking, but the dessert was really good. Overall, the hotel was a great value given the deal we were able to find on the room, very convenient, clean, and we would stay there again for sure if the price was right. 
15511231	 This hotel was recommended by a friend in the area. Was visiting DC for a college visit. My daughter absolutely loved the hotel and the staff (Garnett &amp; Innocent) were very friendly and helpful. Our room was on the 11th floor and faced 14th Street - decent view. Comfy beds, great bathroom, but didn't like the internet fee...too many hot spots around to have to pay for internet. Valet parking was pricey too ($30/day), but compared to parking on the street blocks away, I did what I had to do. Would definitely stay there again. 
15174765	 My husband and I spent a weekend in DC with our dog in April. The staff at the Hamilton were very accomodating and friendly. Our room was on the &quot;pet floor&quot; although I never heard or saw another pet. The bed was super comfortable and the room was so quiet that we inadvertently slept in each morning - which is what vacation should be like! The Hamilton is an old hotel and has a charm that you wouldn't normally find in a chain hotel. Valet parking was a bit pricey but was much more convenient than dealing with parking on the street. My only suggestion to the Hamilton is that they offer free internet access, which I think is really becoming the standard. It costs $10 per 24 hour period. But our room was clean and very comfortable, the bathroom was well supplied with a mountainous heap of towels, a bathrobe and all the normal toiletries. If you are in a hurry in the morning you might want to take the stairs - the old style elevators are slow and only hold 8 people max! But other times of day no problems. It was a very pleasant stay and conveniently located for seeing the city - only 4 blocks from the White House and one block from the metro station. We will gladly stay with them again on our next trip. 
15127508	 When I called to cancel my reservation because military orders had changed, they transferred me around several times. The manager let it run to voice mail and never returned my call. The concierge was terribly rude and barely spoke English. Instead of allowing me to speak and request to cancel she tried to yell over me, and yell at me! Unbelievable attitude. Every single person with whom I spoke was terribly unpleasant and seemingly lazy and none of them wanted to process my cancellation and continued to forward me around the hotel. Finally I just called Priceline hoping they could fix it since the manager of the hotel never returned my call and none of her staff was competent enough to do anything other than scream profanities. Priceline fixed it right away and was wonderful and while I would use them again I would advise against any dealings with this joke of a hotel. 
14648789	 Excellent location. A bit of an older hotel and it shows in the rooms, though completely acceptable and clean. Had a room facing north and between the hotel and the next building there must have been below large trash containers as you could hear from 4-5 am garbage trucks in an out taking the trash out -- which woke me up even on the 11th floor! Besides that, a nice hotel. Seems like Priority Club members get a free complimentary Starbucks voucher of 5$ that can be used in the Starbucks of the hotel which is a nice touch. Would stay again. 
4742253	 we stayed at the hamilton crowne plaza during four days in march, 2006. the location is excellent, an easy walk to the white house and other points of interest, and near the metro. however i did not find this property to live up to the usual standards of the crowne plaza group. it's obviously an old hotel that was spruced up. the rooms are on the small side, but that's not unusual in washington regardless of price range. but i found the room cleaning to be quite substandard... just as a test i noticed the same bunch of hair on the floor inside the bathroom door all four days we were there, and other signs of poor housekeeping. i also thought the front desk crew were neutral at best and sullen on occasion. i would not necessarily say you should avoid this hotel, but i certainly don't think it's representative of a first or deluxe quality property. i might mention that i think this is the first time in many reviews that i've written on this website that i have felt the need to be negative, but fair is fair.<br/> 
4627114	 This was a treat for us to be in such a great hotel. It was classy and pretty. Very professional staff - you ask and you get help. Thanks for all the good tips from the concierge!<br/><br/>Not too many restaurants or grocery stores around the hotel. But the hotel restaurant made it up for us! It was delicious breakfast and lunch!<br/><br/>We would for sure stay there again!<br/> 
4606510	 The Pros:<br/><br/>- Good location (Franklin Square/downtown) and fairly short walk to several Metro stops<br/><br/>- Nice amenities in the rooms, typical of a Crowne Plaza hotel.<br/><br/>- Nice looking bar/restauarnt off the lobby.<br/><br/>- Free fitness center with plenty of equiptment<br/><br/>The Cons:<br/><br/>- &quot;Historic&quot; hotel, so that means rooms the size of shoeboxes.<br/><br/>- The public spaces (lobby) were also cramped.<br/><br/>- A crowded hotel, so that could mean different things to different travelers. For me, this translated into frazzled hotel staff at times. <br/><br/>- No free breakfast: call me spoiled, but I am starting to really value those hotel groups that provide at least a modest continental breakfast for their guests. It's not necessarily a slam against a hotel if it doesn't, but it sure doesn't raise the hotel's rating.<br/> 
4582286	 Great location; helpful staff; very attractive and clean room; comfortable bed. The food in the dining room was very good but the service needed a little tweaking. I would definately stay here again.<br/> 
4561880	 I felt that the reviews of this hotel were very accurate and prepared me well. For the price, I thought this was a very nice hotel in DC compared to other hotels I saw as we were walking that were much higher.<br/><br/>It is close to MCI Center which is why we chose it, but also close to many attractions.<br/><br/>It was a appealing hotel, but yes, rooms are a little small. I thought the room and bathroom were very clean. Staff was pleasant.<br/><br/>We lucked out and were able to check in very early - 9:30 but probably because it was not a busy time in DC.<br/><br/>Although on 11th floor, yes the traffic noise can be a little loud. Not sure if there are rooms away from street, but might be worth asking about.<br/><br/>Night parking is a little steep - 28.00, but again, thought this was a solid value and would recommend.<br/><br/>Chrissy<br/> 
4372795	 Overall, this is a nice hotel at a great location. I spent 3 nights middle of January there. The rooms are very clean, and the beds very comfortable.<br/><br/>Just one word of advice: do not accept a room that end with &quot;44&quot; (for instance 744). These rooms are just behind the elevator shaft, and you have the impression of sleeping in a subway station: every time an elevator is called, it is like having a train running through the room!<br/><br/>Also, if you have a prepaid reservation, make sure to bring a printout with you. I had to force the clerk to call Travelocity, because he wanted to charge my room on my credit card again.<br/> 
220573416	 Selected the Hamilton for a 3night/2 day business trip because it was in close proximity to our DC office and rated well on TA. Everyone in our group was pleased with the accommodations. The staff was professional, efficient and unobtrusive during a busy week that included the U.S.-African Leaders Summit. The decor is well done in this historic building. I stayed on the 11th floor in an inside room with no street noise. Housekeeping was particularly helpful with special requests. For a small $ upgrade at the time of booking, additional amenities in the room included a yoga mat, umbrella, and bath salts. The location is great for tourists visiting DC. and within walking distance to a number of attractions. As I find at many of the hotels I stay in, there were some items that required maintenance for which management appreciated being informed. Overall, I would stay here again. 
220315152	 We stayed 3 nights at this hotel. It is extremely clean and elegant. We had booked - and paid for- a room for 3 people, but they did not put enough towels in the bathroom, and only 2 coffee mugs and 2 glasses. I asked at the front desk and almost immediately had extra towels brought to the room, but never got a third mug, even after I asked the front desk a second time. It is a small thing, but just enough to ruin your morning coffee. I don't give the hotel 5 stars for that reason.<br/>Although centrally located, it should be noted that it is in front of a park full of homeless people, and at an intersection that is very noisy (emergency vehicles and drivers honking), even in the middle of the night.<br/>The restaurant (14K) is o.k.; there are better and not as expensive restaurants nearby.<br/>The cab fare from Dulles Airport was about 70$. 
219972562	 We spent one night at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in early Aug. We do not live that far away in Northern Virginia but it was our anniversary so we attended a play, had a great dinner in the area and spent the night in the city for the occasion. This was not the hotel we originally reserved but due to an overbooking at our reserved hotel we were moved a block away to the Hamilton. When we checked in we were still somewhat perturbed that we had to move to a different hotel but this feeling was quickly dissipated by the greetings from the valet and front desk personnel. Knowing our situation the hotel gave us the wireless for free. We did not use it but it was a nice touch. This is an older hotel listed on the historic hotels in America but it was redone a few years ago and is really nice. The hotel is in a great location at the intersection of 14th and K St NW and is about a 15 minute walk to the White House and the tourist sights on the National mall. There are restaurants, a CVS and coffee shops in the immediate area and lots of other establishments if you are willing to walk a few blocks. The lobby is beautiful. Our room, on the second floor, was very small with no view (unless you count other rooms) but it was quiet and impeccably clean and beautifully decorated. The bed was really comfortable. My wife likes a softer bed and I like a harder bed and it met both of our preferences by having an extra-large pillow-top on top of a firm mattress. We slept great aided by a great adjustable shade/window covering that kept the room very dark. We did not eat at the 14K restaurant but it was pretty crowded on the night we were there. It has a nice outdoor seating area that with a view of a small local park. We did have a few drinks at the bar and really enjoyed speaking with the bartender.<br/>Two things to be aware of: It is $45 a night to park your car with the valet and wireless is not free and since we did not need it I am not sure of the cost.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again but would ask for a bigger room. 
219904821	 Had reservations here but was told that I could not be accommodated the first night of my stay so I was taken to another hotel for the night. That experience was horrible by the way, I checked in here the next day, my room was upgraded to the executive suites (beautiful views by the way), I was sent a wonderful fruit and cheese tray for the inconvenience the night before and after telling management what had happened to me at the other hotel I was given first aide and a voucher for the breakfast buffet the next day. The staff here did everything they could to make me feel comfortable and at ease and apologize for the inconvenience they put me through and I was very satisfied. 
219887088	 The only negative of my stay is that it was only a one night stay. The service, the atmosphere of the Hotel and the rooms were great value. The place is clean, impeccable, with very tasteful decoration. The rooms have great beds, excellent for resting after a whole day of walking and visiting landmarks and museums! The location of the Hotel is also a major plus , in the center of all the main places of interest, easy to walk everywhere and easy access. the white house is at walking distance and so are the Ford Theater and Petersen House, the Lincoln monument and the Washington monument. We actually took that route and walked our way back to the Smithsonian Castle. If you like walking, you will enjoy this Hotel and its location! Great finding in Washington DC! 
219880905	 Although this hotel is not in the very heart of things it's in a good central location, with all the major attractions easily accessible. It's also near to two very good lounges/clubs - The Park &amp; Lux Lounge...as well as Busboys &amp; Poets. The décor was nice, room was clean and the staff were friendly. Also glad to have a fridge in the room. Only gripe is they should invest in some sound-proof windows esp for the 'park view' rooms. 14th St can be noisy at night and it took me a while to fall asleep due to sirens and car horns. Last thing I thought $45 valet parking was too steep at first but then when I worked out how much I'd have to feed a meter (if I found one) or pay at a nearby garage for an overnight and next day it seemed reasonable. Plus you pay for the convenience of being able to come and go 
171888959	 This was a one night stay and a great pick! We booked this on a special through Travelzoo which included two welcome drinks and a $25 voucher to use in the restaurant.The beds were comfortable and I slept quite soundly. The amenities are modern and everything seemed clean. You could smell the brand new carpet in the hallways and we were able to check in at 11. It is very convenient to the metro and if you want to stick with red line routes, Metro Center is only 3 blocks down. If you are interested in biking, there are two Capital bike share stations within 2 blocks as well. 
171879660	 Have visited DC numerous times for work and like the 14th and Kstreet area, so thought I'd give the Hamilton a try. <br/>Friendly reception staff and ok sized room with good amenities. Good location and convenient Starbucks in lobby and good restaurant. 
171814483	 Being a resident of Bethesda, I was tasked with being the tour guide for my family's trip to DC. I decided to book them into the Crowne Plaza since it was very close to everything in DC. Overall I was very happy with the stay. The beds were very comfortable and the room was nicely decorated but a bit smallish for our normal american girth. I don't know if this is the norm for hotels in the area, but you have to pay extra for an internet connection which is crazy given that any flea bag motel usually provides this for free. Also my t-mobile phone couldn't get a data signal in our 10th floor room. We tried to find a breakfast place Sunday morning but a lot of places were closed. Ended up at a DD. <br/><br/>We stayed on a Saturday night so we were prepared for the noise, and it kind of made the stay interesting. Watching drunk people walking around, police sirens etc but no noise from the neighbors which was great. I'd probably try another hotel next time just to see something different but at least I can count on this place for a nice comfortable stay. 
171786193	 We found/booked this hotel on Expedia based on Trip Advisors ratings. It is a VERY nice hotel. It has an in house Starbucks and 14K restaurant which offers good fare for its room service. It IS a walk to/from the Historical sites, but proved not to be too much for my six year old. The rooms are a decent size and have a mini fridge, the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms are well stocked and clean. <br/>The best thing about this hotel is the staff. They were so polite and helpful from the valet, room service and the reception staff. This was a spur of the moment trip for our family and we were so happy to have found such a great place for our stay. 
171666001	 Checked in for one night 2 hours early... no problem. This hotel is super close and convenient to DC sights and the Metro. The staff is very helpful and happily point you where you'd like to go. The cable in our room didn't work, but we didn't bother calling due to our short stay. Parking is a bit expensive ($45/night) so we parked around the corner for $28/night. Overall we had a great stay in this lovely hotel (: 
171464806	 When you first drive up in front of the hotel the valet people are supposed to take your car so you can check in. However, we didn’t know that was the process and pulled up into a parking spot near the hotel and walked in to check in. When the desk clerk told use what the procedure was we just back up our car to the front of the hotel and the valet took care of the rest. The lobby is very bright and there is a small social area, there was also medium traffic going in and out of the hotel. The room was colorful and clean, I really like the way they designed the room even though it was small (which is what I was expecting being in Washington, DC). I hardly heard any noise through the walls, also the gym was nice and clean. <br/><br/>The only thing that really disturb me during my stay there was the situation in the bar/restaurant. When my friends and I came back from a concert at night we went to the bar to get a drink and there was a rodent that crawled through the bar floor, while our order were being taken. At first the waitress ran away from our table, because her back was to it the rodent. So, all she saw were our facial expression and my friends screaming. At first I thought maybe we were seeing things because it was dim in the bar. So we stay and waited for our waitress to come back. When she came back to our booth, she apologized about her reaction. And told use she be more than happy to take our order, as we continued to order our drinks that’s when we saw the rodent again. It ran the long way across the bar floor and we all saw it including the waitress. That’s when she jumped up onto the booth with us and was screaming herself. Needless to say, that’s when we all ran back to the room and just got our car and went out to get something to eat.<br/><br/>When we informed the front desk, they said that the restaurant and bar do not reflect the hotel. So, they said they will inform the manager/owner of the bar and restaurant. They also said that the homeless people who live in the park beside the hotel feed the rats and when they leave the door open to the outside part of the restaurant the rodents might of came in that way. I kind of felt as if they brushed it off like it wasn’t a big deal. We check out the next day so we wouldn’t have to worry about it anymore. 
10019490	 The family stayed at the Hamilton for 4 nights in adjoining rooms. Close to the metro and plenty of restaurants. Agree with the homeless in the park, but were never hasseled, and felt safe. As far as the rooms, ours had a 3rd floor view over 14th Ave, which is busy all day and night (ie noisy). They were definitely smallish, but comfy beds and plenty of towels helped. <br/><br/>Unless you have a package including breakfast, don't bother with the restaurant. Expensive with shotty waitstaff; there is plenty around for much cheaper.<br/><br/>Overall, served our needs, and would stay again if we get a good price. 
10012786	 My husband and I stayed at the Hamilton for nine nights from Sept 6-14th. It is a great location for catching the bus and Circulator (across the street) and is one block from the Metro. There are many restaurants in the area, altho we did not eat at any except Georgia Brown's, which we did not care for. We were seated right in front of the kitchen prep area and it was very noisy. As we were in Washington for the puspose of &quot;seeing the sights,&quot; we did not mind that the room and bathroom were small, as we were only in the room to sleep. We had asked for a quiet room and were given one well off the street, so we did not hear any street noise. The room was made-up each day with fresh towels, etc. When I informed the front desk that the ice machine did not work one evening, it was fixed the next day. The staff in the lobby were very courteous, friendly and helpful. It was nice to have a Starbucks right in the lobby. I would definately stay here again. Thanks for all the previous reviews that helped us make a decision as to where to stay. 
8829688	 I found a good deal via [--] for a king bed room with a &quot;park view&quot; for $249 midweek when most hotels in the downtown core area were pushing nearly $300 or more (last minute reservation). The room -- on the 14th floor club floor - was in relatively new condition, although showing some signs of wear. The king bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was clean. The shower head was a Speakman. The bathtub showed some signs of caulk debeading, and the curved shower curtain rod needed rescrewed to the wall. I could not find any writing paper on the desk, and the Sony CD alarm clock was so confusing to set the alarm that I just called for a robo-wake up call. And the &quot;selection of bagels&quot; for breakfast turned out to be limited to plain bagels (which seems so often to be the case). The elevators, as befit an old property, are small and slow - hard to fit more than three people with bags in them.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, despite my nits, I would stay there again. The price was right, the public areas were attractive, and the room was well-decorated and laid out. My major nit is that the front desk staff was rude. The first staffer gave me a room with double beds and no park view for the higher price that I had paid for the king bed/park view room. She insisted that all rooms were the same price and that there was no different price based on the view, despite the fact that my reservation -- made through the hotel web site -- said so. By the time that I powered up my laptop to retrieve the reservation e-copy and show her, she had left. The other staff relented and gave me the room type that I had reserved, with no comment at all or apology. Whatever . . .<br/> 
8752850	 All the other reviews were helpful in selecting this hotel. Yes, it is a very old hotel that has been renovated. Yes, the bathrooms are very small and the hotel can be noisy (ask for a room facing the back of the hotel). The beds are very comfortable and the location cannot be beaten for the price we paid. Downside was the park right across the street. Be ready for some fairly aggressive begging, it is constant. We could not find any restaurants on Sunday morning, so ate at the hotel. Expensive but good food. Right around the corner is the SoHo Market. The have a breakfast buffet for $4.99 per pound but we found the food to be cold. The fruit was very nice though. The next day we order breakfast cooked to order...there are 3 under $4. and they were very nice with lots of food. We also found the Mozart Cafe at 13th and H. Delicious food, sandwiches and bakery items. Also quite reasonable.<br/> 
8749858	 We stayed at the Hamilton for 5 nights at the beginning of September. The room was of an ok size but with very limited space to store our luggage and close, the wardrobe wasn't big enough to fit one of our suitcases let alone two. <br/><br/>The bathroom was nice but with one issue, the light switch for it was in the bathroom and to the right of the sink. This meant that trying to find it in the middle of a night was a challenge if you didn't want to switch the main room light on.<br/><br/>The restaurant in the hotel was awful. We only ate there once and wish we hadn't at all. We ordered a bottle of wine from their list only for it to take them 20 minutes to discover they had none left. Also when we needed extra cutlery for courses we were given a complete set wrapped in a napkin. By the time we finished our 3 courses we had 6 napkins on the table!!! Food itself was not good and very overpriced for what you could get elsewhere.<br/><br/>The bar itself was ok but with very little atmosphere, even for a hotel bar. <br/><br/>The hotel is conveniently located for a metro stop and it doesn't take long to walk to the White House and all the major sites (20 minutes tops).<br/><br/>The hotel are is ok, there is a park opposite filled with homeless people but we did not feel unsafe at any time whilst we were there, though we did catch a cab back to the hotel if we were out late.<br/><br/>One other issue was guidance we got from the front staff. We had booked a table at the restaurant Acadiana (highly recommended) and asked for directions and what the area around the hotel was like at night. We were told it was a short walk to the restaurant and we would be fine. <br/><br/>However what we weren't told was that it was through an unsafe part of town (the front staff should have informed us of this), if we had known this we would have caught a cab.<br/><br/>For breakfast there is a Starbucks. However we would recommend going to Cosi which is just 2 blocks away. Food is fresh and about half the price.<br/><br/>Overall we felt the hotel was in a good location and if you can get a good deal like we did with Orbitz, well worth the money.<br/> 
8704365	 We booked this last minute through Orbitz for 99$ a night and were not disappointed. The room was a small corner room on the 5th floor with no view, but we didn't plan on doing anything but sleeping.<br/><br/>The hotel is located one block from the McPherson Metro stop or you can take buses that run up and down 14th street. We also walked from the hotel to White House and didn't feel it was too far.<br/><br/>The only complaint I has was that there was no free wi-fi, you have to pay 9.99...we were willing to do, but the wi-fi did not work the whole time we were there. The front desk said it was being worked on, but by the time we checked out it still was not available.<br/><br/>Good point for coffee drinkers, there is a Stabucks in the hotel.<br/> 
46972484	 The hotel is a little older, but the rooms are fairly well renovated. The elevators made me nervous, but the hotel was located near everything. 
46635428	 The Crowne Plaza Hamilton was an enjoyable place to stay while in D.C. It is conveniently located one block from a Metro stop making travel to area attractions a piece of cake. Our room was clean, and the bed was comfortable. The room was very quiet despite the street below being very busy due to a popular establishment. There is a Starbucks attached to the lobby for that morning cup of coffee. There is a nice restaurant and lounge in the lobby as well. We would not hesitate to stay here again. 
45009908	 Really disappointed with the place I would not go back. The hunger for tips is over the normal, the room is as small as it can get and yes, it is a noisy location. Especially a problem if you travel with children as the hotel seems to be used as a motel by young couples visiting the nearby nightclubs. 
44557416	 Clean spacious rooms, tastefully decorated. The noise from the street did not bother me. I slept better and longer than usual because the blinds have a clip attached to them so there are no gaps when they close, I could completely shut out any light. Wireless internet worked well, I was able to connect to work. <br/>Because I was in DC only 2 weeks ago - I stayed at the Sofitel during my last visit- I feel compelled to compare the two hotels. The Hamilton is probably a better value. The room service food is not as good as at the Sofitel, but it is still decent and slightly cheaper. The Hamilton has a buffet breakfast which the Sofitel does not. Service was top notch. Coffee was hot every morning, not luke warm. Housekeeping was very good. Overall a comfortable stay. I would come back here on business. 
44551689	 I had a room on the 3rd floor looking out to an alley and about 40 feet away an office building which could right into my room. So I had the drapes closed the entire stay. The room was small and bathroom small. The room had no space for a coffee maker. The room was very clean and comfortable...and noisy. They did provide earplugs...<br/><br/>Best thing about the hotel is the location. Near all the DC sights and right by the Metro stop. <br/><br/>Overall a nice clean and comfortable place. Just wish it were a little larger and quieter. 
43167912	 Overall our hotel experience was very good. The day we arrived everyone was very helpful but we were tired from walking and just wanted to eat at the hotel restaurant. My wife called downstairs to check the dress code of the 14K Lounge Restaurant and was told it was &quot;casual.&quot; My wife asked if we could wear shorts and was told everyone else would be wearing suits. We felt by the tone of the maitre'd that we were not welcome despite the fact that we were paying $300 a night to stay in the hotel. <br/><br/>Everything was clean..beds comfortable. Convenience to historical sites is good...but don't expect to find very many places to eat nearby because it is in a business district and the restaurants all have similar dress codes. We would stay there again, but would bring the suit the next time 
241006492	 I'd definitely stay here again. Not sure why it's escaped my notice before, but I liked it. Very nice, modern. Great, friendly staff. The 14K restaurant in the hotel is actually very good. Starbucks right in the building. CVS a block away. I had trouble getting on the wifi, called the support number provided, the guys was very nice, got me on wifi quickly and then gave me a free code for my one-night stay. This is an example of great customer service. 
240733394	 While attending a conference, I had the opportunity to stay at this hotel. Very elegant lobby and rooms. The front desk stay was very friendly and accommodating...no complaints! The hotel bar was great! Chris - the bar major makes this an awesome spot to decompress, either before or after long meeting and poster sessions! Again the staff was very kind and attentive. My room was fine - comfortable beds, good bathrooms and very warm. If there is a negative - it was the valet parking of $45/day - you do get the take the car in/out when you need it, but if you are on business - likely - you won't. Overall, for business - it is great - a Starbucks linked internally, and close the Washington Convention and a CVS and Dunkin Donuts - can't beat that! 
240379081	 We stayed one night at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. It was very nice and clean. Safety was at the top of the priority list for the hotel - you had to use your key card to get on any floor in the hotel. The front desk staff were very polite. The lobby was nice and clean and provided a place to sit and wait or work for short periods of time. There is a bar/lounge and restaurant attached to the lobby and also a Starbucks. <br/><br/>There is a large, well equipped fitness room. The rooms were small, but it's a downtown hotel, what are you expecting. The bed is comfortable, television large, clean and updated bathroom, overall - just a nice room for a business trip.<br/><br/>I did think the room was a bit on the dark side, but...it's winter and it was dreary outside and dark most of the time I was in the room - so that played into the darkness of the room. There are ample lamps, it just wasn't 'bright', but again, most likely the weather played a factor.<br/><br/>The only con, is that the ice/vending machines are not on every floor. They seemed to be on the odd numbered floors. I was on an even number, so it meant traveling to find the vending machine. The first ice machine I tried wouldn't work, and I had to find another one. Only a slight inconvenience in the whole scheme of things.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone traveling for business to stay there. Easy walk to the White House and all of the offices in between. Close to a metro stop for traveling as well. Short distance from Regan National. 
240241971	 Love this hotel. Super cozy, decorated beautifully, doesn't feel like a big chain, great staff--just not anything bad to say. The bed and bedding is some of the best I have slept. Only two small points 1)parking is $45 and I think that is extreme 2) the rooms are teeny weeny. I still love the place but you better really like to be cozy if you are with someone in the room ;) 
239931742	 Its an old hotel with small rooms. Rooms and bathroom need a refurbishment. Cleanliness levels were below expected from a hotel in this price range. For similar pricing there are better options nearby. 
239811773	 On 14th and K, the best thing of this hotel is its location. The room is comfortable and spacious. The amenities are of excellent quality. The only problem is the noise. I was in a 7th floor and the AC compressors from the adjacent building was next to my room. And made a lot of noise. Tried to dump it turning the AC of my room and also made noise. Bearable, but still. Otherwise, it was a good experience for the three nights I stayed 
175305759	 hotel was very nice .but the frond desk crew was very helpful. they helped us to print some essential paperwork gave us good directions.i have to say the name of one guy .ravi gaur-very very nice person !!!!!!!.another guy i can't remember his name very good dealing too.infact i left a bag of clths in the hotel abd the team was so responsible in helping me retrive my lost items. very impressive.-RUBY 
174899287	 My husband and I just spent three wonderful nights at the Hamilton Hotel. We are IHG Rewards Club members and used points to book our stay. We stayed on the 12th floor the Executive Club level which included a continental breakfast and hors d'oeuvres in the executive lounge everyday. The room was very well appointed and of a good size. The bathroom was a little on the small size. We had a king size bed that was very comfortable. The location of this hotel is great! We came down to visit the monuments and they were all within walking distance. The metro and circulator bus lines were also across the street from the hotel which gave us extra options for getting around. When we plan our next visit to Washington we have already decided that we want to stay at the Hamilton again! 
174677504	 I have never done reviews before but quality of service at this hotel prompts me to do so as a small gesture of recognition.....Although I have been a PLATINUM member for most of the years since 1999 I have NOT been happy with the priority club chain recently and have been switching to other groups (especially Marriott whose programme seems more intelligent and flexible) so I was not too happy about booking with them on this occasion.....I just booked two nights and ended up staying a week.....Unlike Holiday Inn CROWNE PLAZA is the best of the lot in my view and they ALWAYS seem to have upgrades for Platinum members plus BREAKFAST on the special flloor (and cheese and biscuits in the afternoon) plus ESSENTIAL FREE INTERNET which is a sine qua non just on PRINCIPLE!!!!! BUT the friendliness and efficiency of all levels of the hotel were really impressive.....I was directed to a great Sports bar with the WHOLE VARIETY of SOCCER games live (the Black FINN) instead of others that were NOT good by other people plus the tours and all other information was considered and effective.....Jennifer Hill at the Revenue department and Veronica Roque were especially helpful and again, I dont know if this is normal to mention individuals in these reviews but I honestly feel like doing that !! Rooms are quiet with great mattresses, fast internet and good, comfortable furniture....so I wil definitely book to stay here again and it has restored my faith in the groups of hotels though I DO hope that there is an improvement in Holiday Inn whose prices have become RIDICULOUS for what is on offer and also pretty dodgy franchises abroad, especially in Latin America.....??? Also the challenges system that I am trying now seems over complicated but if it works its a good idea as priority club has really lost its way compared to the other points systems 
174565697	 This hotel is not far from the main attractions. The hotel is on 14th street which merges from the street where you get off the interstate. Just go straight and you will not have any problem finding the hotel on the right side of the street. On constitution street make sure you move your car or truck by 4:00 pm to prevent from getting a ticket from monday - friday. The hotel is excellent, clean and great shape. Our room was changed to one with a view. To us, the best floor to stay on is the 12 floor. Same floor where the continental breakfast is held. Valet service was excellent 24/7. Management and everyone is customer service very friendly and helpful. The park is across the street from the hotel. Bathrooms are spacious. 
174035652	 The Hamilton Crowne Plaza was a great hotel to stay in for value but also for location. It has a lot of character for a Washington DC Hotel. The location was fantastic on 14 Street and K which was a few blocks from the White House and other major attractions. Easy to walk around or the metro stops were close by as well. The hotel has a nice restaurant and bar in the lobby as well which we sat and had drinks at. The staff at the hotel were very nice as well and check in and check out was very smooth. Would definitely stay at this hotel again if in DC. 
173558900	 The best location. We walked about 10-15 to all the attraction. Little far of a walk for the museums. We took a cab $7 or less cab fare. The room was very clean and nicely decorated. We ate diner first night at the hotel in the resturant and the food was excellent. Cons rough sheets, didn't like pillow shape and mattress little to firm for me. ( personal preferences) overall hotel was great. Would gladly stay again. We had a park view room. Great view. 
176740404	 We recently spent a long weekend at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in DC. our room was lovely inside, with a view of the park across the street and the whole hotel appeared to have been recently updated. the hotel staff, from the doormen, porters, front desk staff, to the restaurant and bar staff, all welcomed us warmly and made our stay very special. also the location of this hotel allowed easy access to the subway or other public transportation or even to walk to the various sites we visited. the only down side is the charge for internet in the hotel - we've stayed at other hotels of equal quality who provide internet access w/out charge to their guests. but overall we really enjoyed our time there and would recommend the hotel to others. 
176705433	 We stayed here for 3 nights and found the hotel in keeping with the city, clean, well maintained and friendly. The staff were very helpful, the hotel was nicely furnished and maintained well, we would definitely stay again. 
176379177	 Just spent 3 nights here with my wife visiting from Australia. Very nice hotel and staff. Parking $45 a night but seems to be the norm in Washington. Still don't understand why a hotel at this level needs to charge $12.95 a day for Internet when hotels a quarter of the price are free. This would be my only negative about the place. Happy hour 4 to 8 pm with drink and food at the bar is good value. Great position short walk to White House and open top bus tour stop. Also local $1bus just across road to Georgetown and union station. Tip on Internet crepe cafe directly across the road has free Internet and makes better coffee than the hotels Starbucks. 
176196085	 Just got back from a four night day tour of Washington,we did not know what to expect of this hotel.We were in afor a pleasant surprise,from the very friendly from desk staff to the house keeping, all were very polite and helpful.There is also a great deal on happy hour from 5-7 every night with great food on the menu.The buffet breakfast has pretty well anything you would want,and plenty of it,the staff of the restaurant were also very good.The rooms were very nice and clean,with very comfortable king beds to settle into after a long day of touring.One of my wifes flip flops disappeared, from the room probably with the laundry,so the head of loss prevention offered to go out and purchase another pair for her,great service.We will certainly return there on our next visit. 
176191131	 Hotel is pretty nice.<br/>We stayed here in February '13 with 3 adults in an executive (or club, dont remember the name of it anymore) room. We had a really nice stay here.<br/><br/>Room had some infrastructural problems, but not bothersome.<br/><br/>Too bad you have to pay for wifi (which failed a first time but the reception desk resolved this problem), which is a pitty certainly when staying on club level.<br/><br/>Hotel restaurant hasn't the best food ever, but was nice to be in: nice service, nice seating.<br/><br/>Hotel concierge was nice, we had a lovely chat with him.<br/><br/>Anyways, it was a pleasant stay. You have a really welcoming feeling when arriving in the hotel, which really made my stay.<br/>If I ever come to DC again, I will certainly try to stay here again. 
176183354	 The reception staff was simply superb; everyone was very friendly and made the check-in and check-out process a cinch. The hotel is two blocks from a Metro station (blue/orange line), which can put some considerable savings on the airport (DCA) to hotel commute and gives you easy access to museums and monuments. The hotel is also walking distance from many great and new restaurants on 14th street. I would stay here again just for the great service and great location. The room, although small, had great quality furnishings and classy décor. 
213925959	 My wife and I have just recently returned from another great stay at the Hamilton- Crowne Plaza!! Two things are immediately apparent upon first walking through their door - the lobby/ceiling is very beautiful, and the customer service is terrific!! Although we checked-in rather late, we were immediately welcomed, not only as IHG Platinum members, but as returning guests. It was a warm, gracious welcome! Guests Services was also very helpful and kind, and we received a beautiful, large room! Of course, when you're in DC, you're probably there to explore -- this hotel makes it easy! You'll be within short walking distance of the White House and monuments, as well as shops and restaurants. All in all, a great place to stay! 
213909245	 Courteous staff, good breakfast buffet, mildew in shower, toiletries replenished daily, insufficient towels for number of guests, no extra blanket in room, good rate but must walk a distance to museums and chinatown, close to McPherson Square, small room and bathroom for more than two guest, not informed of hotel amenities did not know hotel bar on roof top 
213543580	 I was delighted to find a hotel that would accept my month old kitten, who was being bottle fed and needed to travel with me. The hotel is less than a ten minute walk from the Walter E. Convention Center. There are hotels that are closer by, but none that is pet friendly. I had to provide a pet deposit, which seemed like a very reasonable request given the potential for damage. In addition, my room was lovely and the staff helpful; they were very acommodating when I needed a late checkout. 
213530523	 Thus five star hotel is located within walking distance to most major attractions in Washington DC and is priced about half the other five star hotels in the same vicinity and includes a copious breakfast with the best coffee in Washington. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the room was large and very clean, and the hotel is quiet and facing a beautiful park. My wife and I spent 8 nights in the hotel in May 2014 and we loved every minute we spent in Washington DC. Would return to this hotel with pleasure.<br/>Joe 575 
212930403	 Comfortable, well appointed, good service. Came to DC for 4 days and stayed here. Everything was nice. The restaurant was average, but that's another story. Rooms pretty small. Max would be two people. 
212502802	 Great place to stay! Close to national mall and many other attractions. Great location for public transportation. 14K restaurant on site has great happy hour prices. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. 
117901976	 Have just returned to the UK from a surprise 40th birthday long weekend away by my husband and stayed in this hotel. <br/><br/>Impressed with the speed of check-in and the service from the concierge and desk staff. Our room was not huge but was perfectly suitable for what we needed and fully stocked with everything we would need. <br/><br/>We didn't eat in the restaurant as it looked a bit pricey but we wanted to experience more of what was on offer outside the hotel. Would recommend the M&amp;S Grill on 13th Street which was fabulous. Ate there twice and was very impressed both times.<br/><br/>I only have a couple of issues - the first was that out of the 4 elevators, only one was working. We weren't told this on check-in and only found out why when a notice was placed in the lobby. It was due to the effects of Hurricane Irene which I fully understand but it would have been nice to have been told. My only other issue (and its a really small one I suppose) was the internet connection. I was using a UK registered iPhone and was unable to connect to the AT&amp;T wireless connection as my phone number was 11 digits and it wanted a US 10 digit cell phone number. I only wanted access to chat to my kids back home but if I had been there on business it would have been another matter - I certainly didn't pursue the issue. <br/><br/>There is a business centre on the lower ground floor which I had to pay to use the internet to check-in for my return flight online but there was a facility to print boarding cards free of charge.<br/><br/>On the whole a lovely hotel, perfectly placed for accessing all the major attractions and a metro station one block away was a bonus. 
117893602	 We stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza during Hurricane Irene - it was last minute due to evacuations and our stay could not have been more pleasant. We are Platinum Ambassador status and were upgraded to a king suite - our friends were given the king executive room directly across from us, even though they were not priority club members. <br/><br/>Positives:<br/>Valet parking - although expensive, it was available. It was nice to know the car was in a garage, especially during a hurricane!<br/><br/>The rooms were great - spacious and well appointed. The one bedroom suite had a king size bed and a separate living area that was perfect for entertaining. The bathroom was clean, but a bit on the small side. <br/><br/>The staff was phenomenal. Our every request was honored with a smile.<br/><br/>Location is great - on 14th Street with shops, bars, and restaurants within walking distance.<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>The pull out sofa was convenient, as our son was with us -- but the mattress was lumpy and not very comfortable.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay in this Crowne Plaza again - but would not take the suite if we were in need of an extra bed. 
117877830	 Great hotel, 2 blocks away from the White House, a block away from Metro going to DCA airport, and right on several MetroBus and Circulator lines. Breakfast, WiFi, drinks are included for IHG elite members. Clean rooms and courteous service.<br/>The only problem we that during a hurricane the week before our stay 3 out of 4 elevators broke down and remained out of service. Guests had to wait for 10+ minutes to catch the working elevator. 
117754166	 Have stayed here dozens of times. The location is fantastic for business in the District or for touring. The rooms vary greatly in size due the age of the building, but are exceptionally well decorated and comfortable. If you are staying with a family, be certain to call the hotel and obtain a larger room.<br/><br/>And, this hotel runs smoothly, from the front desk to maid service. 
117728261	 ARRIVAL: Taxi from the airport to hotel approximately<br/>US$18. We had to wait 30 minutes for our room to<br/>be properly cleaned but check in generally ok. They<br/>gave us 2 drink vouchers to use whilst we had to<br/>wait for our room.<br/>SECURITY: Anyone can walk into the hotel lobby and<br/>take a lift to any floor as you only have to use your key<br/>card to open your room door.<br/>In room key operated safes provided in the room.<br/>ROOMS: Hotel only has 14 floors - we opted for a<br/>rear room with no view as the street noise at the front<br/>and side of the hotel at night is quite severe. There<br/>are no refrigerators in the rooms and the rooms are<br/>very small - limited space in bathroom. Because we<br/>were at the back of the hotel the room was fairly dark <br/>with no view.<br/>INTERNET: Difficult to connect and I had to call<br/>AT&amp;T for assistance every time to get a connection.<br/>The connection is very slow. If you really need an<br/>internet connection then it would be simpler to<br/>stay at another hotel - I use Windows 7 with<br/>Outlook Express.<br/>CLUB FLOOR: There is no Club Floor at this hotel.<br/>However, they will give you vouchers for two <br/>alcoholic drinks each night during happy hour 4pm <br/>to 7pm at the K12 restaurant on the ground floor.<br/>CONCIERGE: Excellent service from the concierge<br/>staff who booked all our tours for us.<br/>HOTEL RESTAURANT: K12 restaurant on the ground <br/>floor has a very basic Continental breakfast with <br/>chopped up fruit selection, cereal selectioin,<br/>bread, jam and 2 day old buns/croissants. Would rate<br/>it about 3 out of 10 for a continental breakfast - full<br/>breakfast avaible at additional cost. Breakfast served<br/>from 6.30 but full selection not available until 7am and<br/>staff are not responsive to complaints/requests for<br/>items missing from the poor selection. Some<br/>breakfast staff have a very bad attitude towards<br/>customers and management needs to address this<br/>problem.<br/>Happy hour in K12 hotel restaurant from 4pm to 7pm <br/>with drinks at half price. Excellent snack menu from <br/>4pm to 7pm. Order 2 main courses at dinner before <br/>7pm and they will include a free 750ml bottle of wine.<br/>Staff in the night restaurant and happy hour are<br/>excellent which is in contrast to the breakfast staff.<br/>TOURS: From the hotel walk to the Old Postoffice<br/>just around the corner in Pennsylvania Ave (about 15<br/>minutes) and take the lift to the bell tower (free) for a<br/>great view of Washington. Take a taxi from the hotel<br/>to Pentagon City Mall (approx US$15) for shopping <br/>and restaurants. Take a taxi from Pentagon City to<br/>Georgetown (about US$17) for shopping and more<br/>restaurants and also Riverfront Mall restaurants.<br/>Visit the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History <br/>and the Aero Space Muesum - all FREE!<br/>Visit the Arlington Cemetery for the burial sites of<br/>JFK, Edward and Robert Kennedy, plus Audie <br/>Murphy - American movie star who starred in over 44 <br/>American movies and was the all time most <br/>decorated US soldier including The Medal of Honour <br/>and 32 other medals including 2 Purple Hearts. <br/>Lee Marvin (US Movie Star) and Joe E. Louis <br/>(The Brown Bomber) US World boxing Heavyweight <br/>Champion of the world are also buried here. Most <br/>Americans have never heard of the latter 3 names!!<br/>TIP: If you do the Arlington cemetery tour make sure<br/>your guide will walk with you to the different sections<br/>as this area covers over one square mile and you <br/>will never find any of the burial sites without an<br/>informed guide. They do provide you with a basic<br/>map when you enter but it is a little difficult to follow.<br/>Using a guide to walk with you will also ensure you<br/>are on time to witness the changing of the guard<br/>ceremony. 
117683120	 Rooms are large clean, and comfortable with upgraded linens and furniture. Quiet and excellent service from staff .Location is excellent for walking to &quot;Mall&quot; areas. Plenty of food and shopping in area. Valet parking worked great for me, they took my car and I picked it up 3 days later when I left! 
183689308	 I went to DC for a work convention and this was one of the recommended hotels. It was a little bit of a walk to the convention center, but actually I preferred being a few blocks from the hustle and bustle around the convention center. Very easy to get to the hotel from Reagan airport via the metro. From the moment I arrived everyone went over and above to make me welcome. Veronica checked me in and out and she made sure I was all set. The room was clean, well appointed and I was upgraded to include a continental breakfast. Special thanks to the very welcoming ladies serving our breakfast and making it feel like a home away from home. Great location, I ran on the washington mall each morning (they even had towels at the door to dry off when I came back) and easy walking distance to many restaurants and sights. After this great experience not sure I will ever stay anywhere else in DC. 
183429901	 We were greeted warmly, checked in early, and were very close to the White House. The Conscier was very helpful when we needed help related to a tour. <br/><br/>We found the room very clean as was the whole hotel. <br/>Dinner at the hotel was beautifully served, kind staff and food was excellent.<br/><br/>This is a very good choice for your stay in DC. 
183331618	 Only a five minute walk to the White House and close to numerous restaurants the Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a good business hotel. It has a character in design and furnishings and very attentive front of house staff. <br/><br/>Rooms are a good size and well laid out. My only gripe was the light switch at the entrance to your room was not a light switch and you had to either find the bathroom light or walk in darkness to a bed side light. <br/><br/>Overall very good. 
183298334	 We absolutely loved this hotel. Very charming, historic, spotlessly clean, and in a great location. The rooms are very fresh and nicely decorated. The lobby is stunning and so welcoming. It was very convenient for us to have a Starbucks off the lobby too. We had an interior room that faced an office building. The view wasn't nice but we'd read that the rooms with better views were noisier, so this was fine with us. Our family of four stayed three night. We didn't want to leave. Two of us had to sleep on a fold out sofa but it was very comfortable and we all slept well. The bathroom was heavenly. Nice water pressure and everything appeared recently renovated. One disappointment was the lack of free wi-fi. We were also surprised by the prices charged by the &quot;business center&quot; -- 49 cents per minute to use a computer without a chair. (See photo.) Needless to say the computers were always available! Also sad to say there was no guest laundry, but they were happy to send my laundry out, for $5.50 to 12.00 per item! To end on a positive note, the staff was very friendly and helpful, and the hotel was beautiful and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. 
182945626	 We love the ambience of this historic hotel. It is located in a lovely area from which we could walk to most of the sights. Our room was well decorated and very clean. We were on the 8th floor, and although we did not have a view, we experience very little noise, from our neighbors or the outside world.<br/>We did not have breakfast at the hotel, but did enjoy happy hour and dinner. We liked the food and the decor of the bar and restaurant.<br/>The best feature of this hotel is the amazing staff. They anticipate your needs and take care of them. The concierge is outstanding. 
182940302	 What a pleasant find!!<br/>After arriving from New York, the serenity of the Crown Plaza was lovely.<br/>Wonderful staff - they were all lovely. Great room and a VERY comfy bed.<br/>We would definately recommend and stay here again. 
208384266	 One block from the metro station. Easy walk to White House, museums. Clean, very friendly staff. Great location! Breakfast was good too. My only complaint would be the beer selection at the bar, but there are enough places so close that it didn't really matter. 
208191322	 Ricardo- front desk manager has always made our stay easier. From the room upgrade room, to defeathering the room due my allergies. Restaurant service is good. The only down fall to this property is that there are no selection for vegetarian, but we make it work by ordering out. Maureen breakfast attend is great as we'll. 
208115957	 We were very pleased with our choice of hotel as the rooms were so nice (if not a little small) and it is located very near the White House. Very comfy beds. The staff were very nice except for in the restaurant where they weren't as friendly. We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant which was very nice just like the breakfast. I had my bathroom door handle break in the night and they came up and fixed within 10mins - thank you. At under $200pn is was great value. 
207865461	 Nice and comfortable hotel. Check is fast and we felt very much welcomed. Nice room not to big but with a very good bed and choose of pillows. Nice bathroom. Only a few blocks from the White House facing a small park. Nice bar and restaurant with terrace where also breakfast is served.<br/>Had no problems with noise or so. Fire station is close by but it didn't get us out of sleep, 
207186894	 The room is very cozy and the breakfast good. <br/>The wifi connexion very limited, but what upset me more was the concierge services. I tried to book a super shuttle to the airport, but the guy gave me wrong infos just to force me to take a taxi. That's not the kind of service I expected in a hotel! 
206945160	 stayed in the executive level of the hotel. in the beginning there were problems with the complimentary breakfast and happy hour coupons, which come with the reservation of an executive level room. also as an IHG member I should get complimentary WiFI, however this was not suggested at the check-in. after complaining about the missing complimentary amenities, these were corrected. unfortunately, hotel staff didn't seem to be aware of the services provided with an expensive executive level room.<br/>all in all things were corrected and after that the stay was excellent. location is great, surrounding area is pleasant and the hotel itself is very nice. 
144778322	 We stayed here for two nights mid October prior to a US road trip. It's a beautiful building in an excellent location. The public rooms are lovely, our bedroom was clean and well appointed, the bed was extremely comfortable. The reception staff and concierge were very helpful in offering advice on getting around town etc. <br/>As others have said, the internet usage charge is expensive since most places have free wi fi now, its something I feel needs looking into.<br/>Great having the Starbucks on site and the bar serves excellent cocktails. 
144763821	 The hotel location is very good for short stay, it is good if you plan to visit the national mall, museums, White House, Madame Tussaud, limited shopping nearby, but underground is close. We did not like the breakfast choices, had Starbucks within the hotel building was good idea. 
144737725	 Great location for getting around to most attractions. Bus and metro are less than a <br/>block from the hotel entrance. Easy way to get around the city. Seniors ride the bus for half price. The hotel is older, yet well maintained. The hotel resturant is expensive but there is a coffee shop next to the hotel. Room is clean and newly decorated. Biggest complaint would be the street noise; however, I'm not sure you could get away from the noise unless your were staying farther away from downtown. Yes, there are <br/>homeless people. Not only in the park next door, but in almost every park we passed<br/>by-- except the one in front of the Whitehouse. Each morning we ate at a coffee shop that featured a smorgasboard and they sold the meal by the pound. Interesting. 
144631662	 Have been staying over a weekend on a DC visit. I liked the hotel. It is truly comfortable, even luxury, but too expensive in my opinion.<br/>The breakfast is not included in the standard rate and parking is totally overpriced. 
144008952	 I stayed here for 2 nights in September and unfortunately it has turned out to be the most stressful stay at a hotel for me ever. But more on that later. What is the hotel like? Its worse points are that it is located right next to what appears to be the main homeless square in Washington DC. And so I don’t advise walking through the park during the day and certainly not at night. If you are in a hurry this hotel is not for you. Average wait time for the lifts is about 15 minutes. The lifts are small and used by both guests and staff so expect to either share with a lot of other people or a big cleaning trolley. I rarely managed to get on first lift coming down as staying on a mid floor which by the time the lift arrived was already full. The staff at the hotel bar are pleasant but insufficiently staffed so again expect a wait time. It is a typical modern hotel with little personality but the rooms are comfortable and do not lack typical amenities. The breakfast was disappointing although you can sit in seats overlooking the homeless square. If given a choice I would opt for a Marriott as a better value option with superior standards of care and hospitality. But as for the stress? Well I arrived home to see an additional $700 charged to my account. It turns out that if you don’t complain about faulty TVs in the room (I did complain – just not in the right way apparently) you are guilty for the cost of fixing the faulty TV. So beware - my advice would be to stay away from this hotel but if you do stay make sure you complain about faults in your room loud and clearly. A bit like this review. 
143926766	 the title says it all. we had to book at the last minute and ended up with a room with a non-existent view. this isn't really an issue for us, since we spent little time in the room anyway, but i'm assuming many rooms share this office building/parking garage view. as with most hotels in dc in the tourist-friendly downtown area, it is annoyingly expensive for a modestly-sized room with no frills. well, it had frills, but they were entirely of the decorative kind. typical of american hotels, wifi comes at a cost. they didn't even have wifi in the LOBBY, which many american hotels at least have. they have an in-house starbucks, which, again, has no wifi. fortunately, dc is a very wired town, so chock-a-block with coffee shops and lunch places with free wifi. their cable set-up was pretty minimal (no msnbc - had to watch dreadful cnn over more dreadful fnc) and not hd. and a bottle of water is $5 (does anyone actually pay for this?).<br/><br/>there really was nothing really wrong with the hotel. i debated giving this a 3-rating. it's very nice-looking and conveniently-located, but is it worth the cost? no surprise that the hilton 2 blocks down was completely and totally booked forever and ever, because it's about $75 cheaper a night. 
134527864	 We just returned from a three night stay at this property. My husband and I took our 7 year old son to see Washington DC. The hotel was great! It was in a historic looking building, which added to the charm, but it was up to date with the amenities. We had a room with a king sized bed and a couch that turned into a bed, so plenty of room for the 3 of us. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the bathroom was big enough for us. <br/><br/>The staff was very friendly. We interacted with the conceirge staff several times and both of the conceirge people we dealt with gave us great advice and were very helpful and had great personalities. They even gave my son a kids pack with crayons, bag and a stuffed animal (which we took to the sites with us!). The front desk and bell staff were equally helpful and friendly. <br/><br/>We went to happy hour each day at the hotel, had appetizers there one night and dinner there another night. The staff in the restaurant were very personable and did a great job. The food was terrific (both the main meal and the appetizers). And the happy hour prices were very good (1/2 price appetizers and $4 wines/beers). <br/><br/>We were .1 miles from the metro (about 1 city block) and within easy walking distance of the National Mall. We did buy a Big Bus tour and caught the bus about 4 or so blocks from the hotel, which took us to sites farther away (Arlington Cemetary, National Zoo, etc.). <br/><br/>Having the Starbucks in the hotel was also very convenient. That got us up and out a bit earlier than sitting down for breakfast and it was great that we could run downstairs and bring breakfast back to our room. 
134438239	 This is what I would call a historic hotel. <br/>The interior design creates a nice 60s atmosphere. The rooms have fair size. The bathrooms are ok but some of the door handles are rather old.<br/><br/>Staff is kind and helpful. Location is great. Restaurant is ok, the food is not impressive, but tastes ok. 
134388915	 location is good for MacPherson metro. not many good places to eat nearby. rooms are small but adequate. Most of the staff were helpful with the notable exception of a couple of the check in staff who could not have cared less. we waited an hour for our rooms. one other issue is with the breakfast service. the buffet is good but one seemed to know when it started each day. the information in the room says 6.30 each day. we questioned this for weekend and was told it was still 6.30. when we arrivedi it was shut and we had ti wait until 7. on our last day it did not open until 6.40. we were pushed for time to catch a flight so we missed breakfast. a potentially good hotel spoiled by a lack of customer focus by some staff. 
134269108	 Was very disappointed with my stay overall.<br/><br/>Firstly, we checked in which was smooth and efficient, which was good as we had a late train into dc from Boston so we were tired. Upon getting to our room we found we had not been given a king room as booked. As it was late I didn't query it until the morning where the staff were actually quite rude in saying that they didn't have any king rooms available - considering that I had booked it 4 months earlier and advised hotel via email of our late arrival, I was very disappointed and couldn't quite understand this response especially when virtually laughing at me when I inquired to whether I was getting what I paid for or if the room we had should've been charged less.<br/><br/>Anyway, the room itself was clean and quite comfortable though the &quot;queen&quot; bed we had was definitely only a double. Heard every noise from hallway and the street and also could here plumbing from upstairs bathrooms.<br/><br/>Location is fantastic, we walked down to national mall and past the whitehouse. <br/><br/>Restaurant and bar were well staffed and provided excellent service. We ate there both nights as not much else around in this area restaurant wise without walking far. Good menu range and both meals were good.<br/><br/>Handy having Starbucks on site - good to grab bite for breakfast.<br/><br/>Shame not to have free wifi. <br/><br/><br/> 
134245040	 Stayed here for the third (3rd) time the forth (4th) of July week. I will only say that it appeared under a different Management then previous visits. This is obvious in the service, throughout the facility. Mainly in the restaurant area. Ate there the first (1st) night and opted for other options the remainder of the trip. The food was &quot;DEAD&quot; (i.e. without any love) on arrival to the table. <br/><br/>I hope the new management gets it's hands around this area, quickly.. Love the location but, the optics of the lack of Service Concerns with management, troubles me in this economy. 
134149830	 At check in, despite having booked through Hotwire, the check in staff upgraded us to a larger room with the sofa. It was really large and plenty of space for our excessive luggage. The staff was excellent it was convenient to have Starbucks right in the hotel. We loved it, and would stay here again. 
162848841	 The bed was super firm. The room was clean, but the breakfast card had writing on it from the previous guest. That makes me wonder what else hasn't been changed. The first night there was a little packed of lotions for &quot;relaxation and rejuvenation&quot;. It ended up giving me hives- or maybe it was the sheets. I didn't say anything to the management, but I guess the packet is for arrival only or the maid didn't replenish the supply. I slept on the other side of the bed and still woke up with hives. It's close to restaurants and the capital mall. The told us the breakfast was included and then charged us. I gave it a 3 because the location is decent. I wouldn't stay here again. 
162716998	 Ok, I'm used to paying more in the big city. But this hotel charges for many services that made me drop my rating from 5 to 4. Wireless = $12.95 per day. Has a business center, but if you want to print something other than a boarding pass, it is $.49 a minute with a 5 minute minimum, and a hefty charge to use the printer as well. $5 for a bottle of water in the room. $42/night valet parking. Stayed two of three days with Priority Club points. No upgrade was offered. Mediocre service in the 14K restaurant. Air conditioning struggled to keep the room cool. Staff seemed to visit the room a lot (dropping off ice, chocolates, etc.) which is fine if you like that kind of thing, but if you don't respond right away, they just enter your room.<br/><br/>On the plus side, tastefully appointed rooms. Great location. I was able to walk to most monuments (Washington, Lincoln) as well as the White House and Holocaust Museum in the 91 degree heat without calling the paramedics and I'm a 56 year old woman. Had to take a cab to the Capitol part way; it's a little too far. Close access to public transportation. Starbucks on the first floor. 
162669677	 Absolutely lush! From the gorgeous and tastefully decorated rooms to the central location and everything in between, it was a sheer delight to stay here. All the staff were a delight, especially Tia who served us for both meals there. What a lovely girl - she should get a raise for excellent customer service! And please do have the strawberry shortcake if you have a taste for gorgeous desserts! I cannot fault the hotel in any way. We felt very privileged to have stayed at this hotel. Highly recommended. Thank you. 
162562270	 I really enjoy the Crowne Plaza Hotels. We stayed here for two nights on a mini vacation. The service from the time the bellmen greets you at the front door to anyone you meet is outstanding. They all have a plesant greeting and ask if they can help you with anything. If you need any help getting tickets to an event or dinner reservations contact Andre Barriteau the Concierge. He was so plesant and knowledgeable. In fact he told us about a great Jazz club called Hamiltons just a few blocks from the hotel, and got us tickets for that night.The room we had was on the 12th floor. In fact they were all just renovated and we had a room with a king bed which much larger than most city hotel rooms. They also give you a free quart bottle of warter with a mini refrigerator to use. If you happen to get on the executive floor, they provide you with a great buffet breakfast, and at night they treat you to some great appertizers and cocktails. I know the next time I am in DC I will be staying here. Kudos to your entire staff they go above and beyond in customer service. 
162495287	 Very nice hotel for the price. Everything was great except the restaurant was sub par. If you get the executive package there is great food on the 12th floor. Could have been closer to things but it was walking distance to main attractions 
162338815	 Fabulous hotel, 3 blocks from the White House! Great rooms. Clean. Luxury. Fabulous staff. What more can I offer?! There were zero defects! LOVED this hotel.<br/>I wanted to seek out the Manager to compliment him on his hotel and his staff, but time got away from me. <br/><br/>I kept pinching myself to make sure I wasn't dreaming... 
10331754	 This hotel smells like the sewer. I had to stay there for a conference that took place inside the hotel. During the conference, it smelled awful. In my room, it smelled awful (other conference attendees concurred). When I complained, they offered to come &quot;spray the room.&quot; This problem is likely a sewer pipe leak that is not being addressed. I did change rooms and got a new one that was farther away but given the expense, and how nice this hotel is supposed to be - they are going to be rotting in their own waste soon! 
10081756	 This attractively renovated hotel in an excellent downtown location afforded myself, daughter, and granddaughter a very pleasant weekend experience. The location is convenient for visiting the Capitol's sights and events. Best of all is the hotel staff that works hard to serve its guests and ensure a pleasant stay.<br/><br/>The two double bed room was very clean, attractively appointed and quiet. Though we were near the elevators no noise from them or the street four floors below marred our visit.<br/><br/>The only flaw was my failure to fully comprehend that my debit/credit card does not work fully as a credit card in this venue. The reservation clerks made every effort to explain how this works at this hotel and helped me make my card pay for my room as easily as possible. <br/><br/>We will look no further for hotel accommodations when visiting Washington. We like this Crowne Plaza very much and highly recommend it. 
10059151	 Stayed at the Crowne Plaza The Hamilton when I visited Washington DC for a weekend along with my family.<br/><br/>I arrived at Balitmore airport which was far from the hotel (next time will opt for reagan airport or dulles). So spent $80 on cab which wasn't too smart.<br/><br/>Reached the hotel ... overall seemed good. The staff was polite, friendly and helpful.<br/>The room we had asked for had 2 double beds so the 4 of us managed. Room size was a bit cramped though.<br/><br/>Housekeeping service was efficient and smooth.<br/><br/>The location of the hotel is very good. It is close to McPhereson metro rail station (just one block away) and we could easily catch trains to all the attractions - smithsonian, capitol, washington monument etc.<br/><br/>Distance to White house was walkable and we didn't need to take a train.<br/><br/>Would stay here again if I visit DC. 
10047873	 Very nice hotel! Our room was clean and had very nice views. The (2) beds were very confortable and complementary bathing set (shampoo, conditioner etc.) was a nice touch. The hotel, as soon as entered, gives you a nice, home like feeling, since reception is not highly visible and lobby has lots of details and confortable seating. We did use this hotel for one night stay only, but still would higly recomend it. 
10026326	 No complaints at all. The location was ideal, within an easy walk from the White House and nice restaurants nearby. The hotel itself was perfect - really nicely decorated, big rooms, comfy bed and spotlessly clean. 
10024131	 On checking into the hotel we were shown up to our FIRST room, this was a twin, not a double as booked and smelled really badly of old drains or damp carpet. We asked for a change and was put in room (I think) 201, which is directly above the Starbucks on the ground floor and adjacent to a service road. No sleep was had that night. The next morning we changed room again and were put in room 1443 on the 14th floor at the top of the hotel. This room actually vibrated with noise as the main air con unit for the hotel was located directly above our heads on the roof of the property. By this time we were too exhausted and jet-lagged and had only one night left before we moved on otherwise we would have checked out and found another property. The hotel staff were rude and incompetant, (especially a certain female restaurant manager). The complaints here are too many to list, its really quite boring..avoid this hotel at all costs... 
215976243	 This hotel was our home away from home for four nights. My husband, kids, and I squeezed into a two double bed room, which, in retrospect, was not the best idea because the room was small for all four of us. However, we made it work. The beds were actually incredibly comfortable and the room was quiet (we didn't hear hallway noise). The hotel staff was very friendly and attentive. Starbucks was right downstairs so it was very convenient to get coffee in the morning, but our room did come with a keurig coffee maker. The bathroom was very small - even for two people staying in a room - since there is really no counter space at all.<br/>The location is convenient to the metro so it was easy to get around the city. However, it is a bit of a hike to the Mall area if you want to walk.<br/>Overall, a nice hotel. 
215848594	 Everything was very good. Reception was friendly. Room was nice, bed was comfortable with many pillows. Only minuses were a very noisy air-conditioner and engine room or something next door. I did not have breakfast but bar service was good. 
215822245	 We stayed in the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for 6 days in May and really enjoyed the stay. The location on 14th and K is very convenient for visiting the various places of interest and is within an easy walk to the tour bus terminals for traveling further out into the city surrounds.<br/><br/>The decor is a little unusual on entering but not unattractive, the room was spacious and well appointed with good facilities in the bathroom. Cleaning and general room maintenance was prompt and efficient. Checking in and out was quick and correct. The concierge went to a lot of trouble to secure tour bookings on short notice and this service was typical of all the staff. <br/><br/>There is a very good bar and restaurant which was great for the end of the day although we found the breakfast to be fairly ordinary.<br/><br/>A good hotel, conveniently located and 
215604730	 I spend five days here while attending a series of meeting at the convention center. <br/>I was upgraded to a beautiful one bedroom suite overlooking the park. It was well disigined and maintained.<br/>Daily breakfast on the concierge floor were basic but appreciated.<br/>The buffet breakfast in the main dining room was excellent.<br/>Dinner in the main dining room was quite pedestrian... I can't really recommend it..<br/>The fronts desk, valets, door men all went out of there way to greet me daily and offer help.<br/>All in all this hotel is highly recommended. 
215514422	 Pro : fancy and nice, location, service.<br/>Cons : parking, breakfast, luggage deposit security. <br/><br/> I have a short and comfortable stay at the Hamilton Crown Plaza. The room was nice and clean. Exactly what you can expect from a middle-luxury class hotel. <br/> The parking is valet-only. Leave your car in front of the hotel and they will park it somewhere. So, if you forget something inside your car, it can be difficult to retrieve. <br/> The Hamilton Crown offers a lot a valet services. Personally I prefer the do-it-yourself kind of hotel. I’m not very comfortable when someone takes my luggage up to my room. But, if you like this kind of stuff, you will be served.<br/> The hotel-breakfast was a little disappointing. You can find everything you usually get in any standard hotel brunch, but not really more. It didn’t really match with the overall quality of the hotel. <br/> I also have some concerns around the security of the luggage deposit. I was able to pick my luggage without any verification. I didn’t found this very secure. 
214980722	 Classy hotel,nicely decorated rooms<br/>Reception staff and concierge extremely helpful and knowlgeable.<br/>Very close to all major attractions such as the white house/the Mall.<br/>Good restaurants and breakfast places in walking distance. 
167561496	 The hotel has a good location in DC, a mile north of the mall and 5 blocks or so fromt he convention center. I stayed here for 4 nights. I found everyone helpful and kind. The room was a bit small in keeping with older hotels that have been updated. The lobby is not large, the hotel has a nice restaurant and bar connected to it. The street is busy but our room was quiet. I stayed here because it was a good deal on the internet. My complaint is that the cost of the internet was 12.95 PER DEVICE per day. So much for my wife and I using seperate wireless devices. This extra cost made the value not quite as good. Nonetheless, I would come back. 
167230770	 It was just a short getaway, but from the outset we were made to feel very welcome. Check in staff were courteous, processed us quickly and advised us about our included breakfast as an IHG Rewards Club perk. This is a heritage hotel, and proudly stands with several in this city, but to its credit it saves the stuffiness for the others. The room felt like a true guestroom, clean and neatly decorated, with a huge flat screen TV, an empty fridge, a coffee maker and excellent blackout curtains. Bathroom was spotless, and the amenities were in keeping with this level of hotel. The air con was unusually loud, though it was a constant hum so did not disturb our sleep. There was some noise from the corridor, but I attribute this to our proximity to the elevator. <br/><br/>The hotel bar is trendy and serves tasty appetizers and cheap beer and wine during the extended happy hour, so avail of these. You can sit inside or out, with the terrace tables overlooking McPherson Square. We misunderstood the check-in staff advice that we were entitled to a free appetizer (rather they must have been letting us know about happy hour), though at $7 a plate, that certainly doesn't break the bank. And Sunday breakfast more than made up for it. A delicious spread served in a relaxed atmosphere.<br/><br/>It does need mentioning that most DC hotels charge a high price for parking (with valet the only option), and this hotel is no exception. That is unfortunately the market. However, while very courteous, this valet service did seem unusually slow. They do advise you to call for your car 20 minutes in advance and that seemed about the minimum. So, if you're in a hurry, don't leave it until just before you check out.<br/><br/>On weekends, DC lets its hair down, and hotels let their prices follow. This place was perfect for our weekend getaway, within walking distance of where we wanted to be and a restful oasis amidst unpretentious, friendly staff. 
167107771	 This is the second time I stay at this hotel. This is a consistently great hotel. Rooms are very nice, clean w/ good amenities. The location is great: <br/>1. It is in the downtown near the White House. An easy walk to the National Mall.<br/>2. There is a Metro station two blocks away. <br/>3. Walking distance to the Washington Convention Center. <br/>4. Located across Franklin Park. A pleasant little park, visible from the outdoor seating of the restaurant/lounge. Also a good landmark on city maps. 
167098274	 Although I did not actually stay at this hotel, based in my recent interaction with Louis, the Concierge, I will be staying here the next time I am in Washington DC. <br/>I called the concierge desk looking for a special amenity for a friend who was staying at the hotel. I had very specific items in mind and Louis, without skipping a beat told me that the hotel did not stock the amenity I wanted to send, but he would personally go to Whole Foods and purchase what I requested and insure the items would be placed in the room for my friends arrival. This hotel has done a great job in hiring Louis and practicing hospitality. I can't wait to stay here. 
166855594	 One of those historic hotels we a hip twist that makes it my preferred home away from home when I go to DC. Straight line shot down 14th St if you are taking a cab from DCA and an easy block walk to the Metro and not far from the White House. Hotel staff seems like it has been there forever and they are as sharp as they come. Rooms recently renovated which was overdue but a welcome change. The restaurant bar 14/K have many locals and 1/2 price appetizer early bird specials has me there for an affordable dinner in a sleek looking room. Food is truly outstanding and rarely do I ever go out to dinner if solo. While many places you may feel odd eating alone at a restaurant bar, not here. Just a cozy feeling. Health club is better than most. 
166572852	 My family of 4 including 2 children stayed at Hamilton for 1 night after a long drive from Boston. I am a Gold member and used points to stay here for 2 double beds. I was recognized immediately for the benefits of free WiFi and free continental breakfast upon check in.<br/>However, when I opend the door to my room, there was only 1 bed. I returned back to the front desk, and the receptionist said all the double rooms are booked. Then she offered 'Executive suite' with a pull out sofa room on the 14th floor with card key access only.<br/>Room is very clean and nicely decorated. Noise from outside was pretty loud even we had a highest floor, so must be noisier for the lower floors rooms.<br/>Continental breakfast didn't have much of a choice, so we opted to have a hot breakfast upgrade for $7/adult and had made to order omlet. Valet parking was $45 and took 30 minutes to get our car to hit the road.<br/>Overall, staffs are very friendly and helpful. This is one of my favorite hotel and sure to be back when I visit DC in the future. 
252450552	 Perfectly located hotel is you are planning a trip to DC.. Walking distance to the White House as well as the Smithsonian museums, and pretty much all the memorials around the area including the ones for Lincoln and Martin Luther King. These are all within 2 miles of the hotel. <br/><br/>The hotel is also surrounded by restaurants, coffee bars and the odd theatre so you'll never be short of things to do. <br/><br/>The hotel itself is a franchise and not IHG owned which may account for the disgracefully high $45 per night for parking. Had it not been for this and the small and not very well appointed rooms the rating would have been excellent. <br/><br/>The room whilst well equipped with all the amenities you are likely to need is relatively small. The placement of the TV in relation to the bed or sofa is also odd and certainly something that could be improved. <br/><br/>If you prepay for breakfast you get access to the buffet in the morning.. Not a great selection of hot food but a wide enough choice across the buffet to cater for most.<br/><br/>Attached starbucks is handy for those that need it but it closes at 7pm so you'll need to head out if you want anything later in the evening..<br/><br/>ps.. If you're staying here and need a snack look up the local &amp;pizza.. great place for some great food.. 
252446222	 This hotel had a lot of things going for it - it's in a great location, it's clean and the service is awesome! The lobby is beautiful. Check in was quick. We were given a room on the top floor. Not the biggest room, but enough room. We were there 3 nights. One night the bed was turned down and we got chocolates. I'm not sure what happened the other 2 nights. I travelled with only hand luggage so didn't bring a lot of the regular toiletries. They had everything I needed. I even used their shampoo/conditioner to wash my hair - it was great quality. Everything was really clean - no mildew etc. The bed was super comfortable altough I did end up with elbow burns from the sheets which was odd because they were soft. The TV in the room was in an odd location (to the side of the bed) - however, we weren't there to watch TV. The room had it's own thermostat which was welcomed. There was also an iron/ironing board, coffee maker etc - all the usual stuff. <br/><br/>We had breakfast included. I had made-to-order omlettes which were fab. They also had the usual spread - cereal, yogurt, muffins, pastries, bread, fruit, scrambled eggs, potatoes, pork sausages, bacon, pancakes etc. It was the same every day, but still enough choice to have something different everyday if you wanted. There is a Starbucks attached to the hotel. However, it closes at 6pm or 7pm depending on the day - far too early for me to take advantage of it. There's not a lot of food place around. There's a Pret A Manger nearby where we had a bite/coffee. We ended up eating on E St NW a couple of times - about 15 mins walk from the hotel but we enjoyed the walk. <br/><br/>We walked to all the sites from the hotel and took the car when we went to Arlington cemetary. It was a bit cold, but overall easy walks everywhere. We were going to take the hop on/off bus, but didn't need to in the end. It would have been faster, but I think we saw a few things we would not have had we taken the bus. <br/><br/>If you have a car then you have to use the valet service ($45 p/day). We used the gps to get there from the airport so didn't go to the wrong Hamilton like other people seem to have. There's a Crowne Plaza flag on the corner - if you see that then you're at the right place! There's free wifi for IHG members (which my friend is). The internet was fast enough for our purposes. There's a bar open in the evening - we didn't go there, but it was always busy in the evenings. <br/><br/>Overall, we had a great stay and I'd definitely go back. 
250677029	 My wife and I have 2 kids (4 and 1) so you can imagine we do not get a lot of nights out where the grandparents watch the kids for us. While we love being parents and catering to our children, it was nice for a change to be catered to by The Hamilton staff. They really have a great staff that is heads above others which is what seperates them from many others. You will have the feeling of being the most important person in the room with everyone on The Hamilton staff. <br/><br/>I do have a chance to travel several times throughout the year for work to numerous hotels and would put The Hamilton staff against any of them. My examples would include:<br/><br/>1) Bellhop/Valet - Greeted us with a smile and welcomed us to the Hotel. He then helped us quickly get our luggage from the car and inside the hotel. Since it is so cold right now (January) this was much appreciated. The valet took the time to explain how to get the car and let us know to call anytime we wanted our car and it would be about 10 min max.<br/><br/>2) Front Desk - While almost any front desk will greet you with a smile, The Hamilton Hotel front desk went above and beyond. We wanted to get out into the city for lunch and the front desk associate gave us good recommendations for close restaurants which we tried one (Old Ebbit Grille) and really enjoyed it. She took the time to give us good directions (print out a map and highlight) to make sure we were all squared away.<br/><br/>3) Restaurant Staff/Room Service - On Saturday night after being out in the city we came back to the restaurant for a few snacks and drinks. The bartenders were also extremely friendly and inviting. We were not sure what we wanted and I asked for his recommendations on a couple items on the menu. He recommended the Steak Tacos which were absolutely fantastic. The next morning when we woke up, we decided we wanted some breakfast, and had a craving for eggs benedict but we did not see it on the menu. We called down to order food, and to our delightful surprise, after asking they said it would be no problem to make what we wanted and that they would have it up shortly. As you can imagine, the eggs benedict hit the spot. <br/><br/>In the end, we were so excited to leave to see our children but we were sad to leave the fabulous service The Hamilton Hotel staff provided.<br/><br/>I would absolutely stay here again and would definitely recommend my friends and family to stay there as well. The Hamilton staff made it a very memorable stay that was thoroughly enjoyed by my wife and I. 
250608593	 Hotel is in good location in downtown DC. Close to Metro stop. Beautiful clean rooms with nice amenities. Starbucks in the lobby a +++. The gym was well equipped and everything was functional. The staff was very friendly and always at your service. 
250451760	 We stayed here for 3 nights and had such a fantastic time. We caught the train from the airport which was quick and easy. The hotel is so easy to find about 1 block from the subway. We arrived later in the day and our rooms were ready.<br/>Check in was quick and easy and we had a lovely room. Not the biggest room but it had charm, a very comfy bed and very clean not much of a view but this did not bother us as we were out most of the time.<br/>The concierge was incredible one of the best ever! He was so helpful, we went for dinner before our night tour ( Japanese restaurant also recommended by him - go here if you like Japanese food) and were starting to run late due to the food taking long to come out. The concierge made sure the driver did not leave without us. He was also helpful with information on attractions and what not to miss with the short time we had.<br/>We did not eat at the restaurant but did get breakfast from the Starbucks attached to the hotel. Overall if your looking for a great quality hotel with charm and character you cannot go wrong.<br/>Cons - None. Everything was perfect. 
249936838	 This is a really good hotel. It is so central to everything like the white house, all the museums and it is close to the Washington monument. The staff are so lovely in the hotel. Especially the manager of the restaurant. He could not do enought for us. The rooms are lovely. We booked a king park view. The only thing about this room is that the park it over looks is full of homeless people. Myself and my partner felt so bad for them that we went out and bough them all sandwiches. Other then that it is a lovely hotel. 
65980335	 I am afraid that this review will look like the management of the hotel wrote it, but truly my stay was perfect. Room was beautiful and clean. Staff went out of their way to help with any requests. Room service was quick and delicious. Location was perfect, walking distance to many sights and one block to the metro. Located in what seemed to be a safe area; as a lone woman, I walked back to the hotel each night around 10 pm with no problems whatsoever. I was even upgraded to the concierge floor. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
65770981	 Overall, an average hotel with not so great service. <br/><br/>After waiting 25 minutes in line to check in we were given a room that reeked of smoke. We were then given a new room and to our surprise found another family occupying that room ! After complaining to management we were quickly upgraded to a larger room. <br/><br/>Found the service at the hotel restaurant to be rude and slow. On our first evening, we purchased a small cup of milk for our young son - didn't mind the $5 charge so much but they made us wait 20mins for it. Would understand if it was busy, but, it wasn't . <br/><br/>On a positive note, excellent location and walking distance to many attractions. 
65427359	 We got a room with a view at an alley, back to the reception and ask for another room. We got that other room, it was a room with a better view, but in the evening there was a LOT of noise from outside!!! Rooms are fairly small. Without the earplugs we couldn't sleep. It was next to a dancing bar... You have to pay a lot for internet ($12.95) and also car parking was around $36 per night.<br/>Our shower was broken (was made) and the staff wasn't very kind. We are definately not going back!<br/>Only positive side is the short walk to National Mall (around 10 minutes). 
65409187	 First time in DC. We did walk to all the attractions. About 5 miles each day. We read that the rooms were small but that was the smallest room we ever stayed in. The staff was nice but very disapointed for the price we paid. We didn't receive the complementary breakfast, &amp; use of the bathrobes &amp; CD player that was stated under ammendities. Couldn't adjust the air in the room. Very humid. They had internet service but there was a cost to use it. Our room overlooked Franklan Park with all the homeless people hanging out in it. We did get ear pugs for the noise though. The only mirrors were in the bathroom. It was too small to have two people in there getting reaady at the same time. Don't remember when we didn't have some sort of cooler in the room.The cost of the parking was almost the price of one nights stay. We never spent so much to stay in a hotel for 3 days before even with the discount. Needless to say we would't recomend this hotel to anyone. 
64312677	 We had a quick and friendly check-in. The room was very clean and spacious. It was definitely roomier than the average hotel room. Our view was atrocious, however. We were on the inside of the U shaped portion of the hotel over the lobby. Our room was right off of the elevator, room 330, and looked down onto the roof of the lobby. The view rates a 0/10.<br/><br/>I thought I'd have a problem with being right off the elevator, but it ended up being more of a perk than a hassle. We had no noise problems traffic outside the room or with the elevator itsself.<br/><br/>The Capital Hamilton is very close to the White House and is easy walking to the Mall for your sightseeing needs.<br/><br/>This hotel charges for wireless internet access. This is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. At hundreds of dollars a night, do they really need to nickel and dime you?<br/><br/>On the morning when we checked out, there was a bill slid under the door for parking...about $33. The problem - we didn't park a car. However, the lady at the front desk took the charge off our bill without question. So it was nice not to have to argue.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the hotel is obscenely priced for what it offers other than being close to the White House. I would recommend it to those that can afford it. Otherwise, stay a little farther out and use the metro - I found it very clean, safe, and uncrowded. 
64118404	 We had a very nice stay at The Hamilton- the staff were efficient and friendly, the beds were wonderful ( especially after a long day of touring!) and clean. It took me two days to discover the hairdryer hidden behind the towels tho. And I agree with other posters regarding the location of the coffeemaker- it was not only in the bathroom, it was on a shelf about 6&quot; off the floor- I cant imagine using it without a good scrubbing and with Starbucks on site it was not something I was inclined to do. I do think the management should reconsider where the coffeemakers are. The counter space in the bathroom is very limited... with 2 women it was really cramped. Other wise the shower was great, and the room came with loads of thick fluffy towels. We had a nice park view, and there was only one night where we heard much noise at night beyond the usual traffic noise that is to be expected in a big city. I wish the windows had been clean- they were quite dirty - it would have been a nice view. <br/>We walked everywhere- it was definitely do-able to walk to the monuments, museums, Chinatown, if you are in reasonable shape. <br/>We would stay there again. 
162167306	 Beautiful boutique hotel on 14 st near the white House! front desk staff very attentive! room was well appointed and very clean!! Restaurant was beautiful but it lacked costumer service! we were seated outside ! the waiter kept coming by and never acknowledge us! we waited 10 mins, at that point I called the busboy who also never came to our table, 20 mins later we decided to leave! it was shocking that such a beautiful place had the poorest costumer service I ever seen! As we were leaving a ran into the manager , he apologized but I feel he could have done more 
161502397	 What a wonderful experience. From the moment we got out of the cab, the doorman took our bags and walked us to the front desk. Mallory was at the front desk and she was just lovely and always smiling and eager to assist us. <br/><br/>Being a Priority Club member we were upgraded to the 14th floor to a lovely suite. We could see the Washington Monument from our living room. The bath and body products were Templespa, the bath and shower gel was very nice, the shampoo was ok but the conditioner was heavenly.<br/><br/>A neat little product on our bed was called Sleep tight, it was a three step process, first you put on repose mositurizer on the face and neck, then you spray the calming mist all around the bed and finally you put a gel on your legs and feet. We slept right through to the morning.<br/><br/>I would always wish to stay at this hotel for every visit to DC. 
161493842	 I stayed at this hotel in February of 2013 to celebrate my birthday in the DC area. What I liked most about this property other than the cleanliness, staff attention and location is how I was treated as a guest. I stayed at this hotel as an employee of Intercontinental Hotels Group, at times I've stayed at other IHG properties and felt I did not get a premium stay or accommodations because I was a employee-guest and not simply a full-price paying guest. I did not feel that way about this property. As soon as my guests and I arrived we were warmly greeted by the doorman. We had even arrived way ahead of check-in time (which I understand is an inconvenience being a former hotel worker myself) however we were still granted entry to a fabulous room on the 8th floor. It was very clean and the decor was fresh and current. I enjoyed my time in DC and at this property and I intend to return. 
161212408	 We were very pleased with the quality of the hotel and restaurant. Excellent happy hour between 4pm and 8pm. Lots of food choices that were well-prepared and well-priced. Only one small issue - our first full day there, our room was still not cleaned by 330pm when we returned from sight-seeing. A quick call to the front desk resolved that and there were no further issues. Very pleased with the response. Great location -- close to White House, and 20 min walk to the National Mall. Metro one block away. Would stay there again. 
161122090	 The hotel has a great location - close to shops and the White House, and less than 10 minutes and you're in the National Mall. Loved the 24 hour gym, and having a starbucks in the hotel is great. Room service was excellent. The only drawback - the top floor is very noisy from the machinery from the hotel. Given this is a club floor, I didn't expect to have to put up with so much noise. Otherwise though, a great hotel, well maintained and fitted out and very helpful staff. 
161016418	 We stayed at the Hamilton on Friday the 11th May 2013 , I can not rate this hotel high enough ! We were greeted as priority club Platinum members and upgraded to a suite on the top floor! The suite was luxury and better than most I have stayed in! Bar and restaurant service were excellent and the food was fantastic. Special mention to the concierge who helped us with lots os DC questions! The only bad thing I can say about this hotel is the wifi charges €12 per night per device! Most intercontinental hotels ares free for platinum members or just free to guest! We had four device with us ! That's 48 dollars per night! Way out of line with the market. Never the less a great hotel and worthy of a 10/10 
249519253	 Beautiful hotel, the service was over the top fabulous, it has a floor for women travelers with extras like yoga mat, magazines, good smelly products, a full tub. I felt very pampered and taken care of there as a woman traveling alone on business. 
249342756	 Nice people, nice room, nice central location. The room was very reasonable. I was there for a conference- and I would stay there again. There was some construction but it was not not a problem for the little bit of time I was there. 
249217890	 This hotel carries very high-end finishes and style for a very reasonable price. The convenient location very close to the White House is also a plus. Valet parking ($48 per night) and the restaurant are expensive but are easy to swallow with a very competitive room rate. I would definitely consider coming back here in the future. 
248804960	 Arrived New Years Eve with my husband and two exchange students. It was a very nice place to stay. Many things to do in a short walk from hotel. Our exchange students like the hotel location, McDonalds was not to far away. I do not like that Trip Advisor wants 200 words for reviews I do not always need that many. 
248305783	 I enjoyed stay here because it was in downtown. Tons of nice restaurants and a nice walk to monuments,museums, and sites (including the White House). There is a Metro station really close for going farther distances. The only down side was it was close to park where many homeless gather. My friend and I were approached every time going to and from the Hotel. I was even followed into a CVS. I don't fault the hotel it was just sad to see and also frustrating because I couldn't get around it. I helped one guy and maybe word got out. It was a little overwhelming. <br/><br/>Classic with a modern twist.<br/><br/>The Bar/Restarant in the hotel is great! 
248305266	 We stayed here on Christmas night. It was our first stop during a road trip to Florida. The parking surcharge is expensive (IIRC $28). The parking on the street ended up being free for both Christmas and Boxing day so we opted for that. The area was a little sketchy though as I wasn't too familiar with downtown Washington. The room was nice and clean the bed was comfortable which when spending hours driving is all you can really ask for. It was in walking distance to the White House which was a definite bonus! 
160846340	 Nice Hotel, centrally located in this beautiful city. White House, Smithsonian Museums and various other attraction were within easy walking distance. A 15min walk took us to the nearest hop on hop off bus stop &amp; the city central. Staff were very helpful, however the park across the road attracted homeless people. They did not give us any cause for concern. 
160793111	 I stayed here for three nights. We had three rooms and the hotel was great at getting all those rooms together. The staff was friendly, especially the valet/doorman. The location was undeniably amazing.<br/><br/>We ate at the hotel restaurant twice, which was very good. However, one of our rooms ordered breakfast and it was not very good and very overpriced. We stuck to the Starbucks after that.<br/><br/>The rooms are spacious and clean. However the lobby had several trashcans around the seating areas and every time I sat down, they were filled to the top. 
160695020	 I stayed here recently on a business trip. I am often in DC, but had never stayed at this hotel before. I chose it because the conference I was attending had gotten a special rate. It turned out to be a good deal and I liked that fact that is was close to so many DC attractions. I found the room to be very tidy and spacious for DC. If you stay, I also recommend the hotel restaurant--good for a hotel restaurant and great happy hour specials.<br/><br/>One complaint-- I am a light sleeper-- this, like many other hotels, had very noisy doors that slammed when other guests were going or coming from their rooms. 
160555600	 We stay here because I got a great deal on Hotels.com. We were in town for an even at The Hamilton Live just a few blocks away. Overall the stay was acceptable. Check in was fast, of course parking was a fee but it's DC. The valets were friendly and helpful. Our room was excellent, clean, roomy, and comfy with the exception of the temperature. It just did not get cold enough for us. It was a warm, humid weekend so perhaps that hindered the productivity of the A/C. With the addition of a pillow topper on the matters that kept in your body heat, I didn't not have a super night sleep. Even odder was the unusual warmth in the hallways. It made me wonder how hot they would be in the middle of summer. It was as if the hotel was conserving and the only A/C was in the rooms (sub-par) and in the lobby. Next trip I'll try another hotel. 
160409844	 I stayed for 4 nights at the Hamilton Crown Plaza in May and overall I had a great experience.Room was clean and probably recently renovated because everything still smells new.<br/>The park near apparently is a favorite spot for homeless, so I tried not to be adventurous after dawn, but the guy from the Concierge said that was ok. I had lunch at the restaurant of the hotel once, but I wasn't very impressed. My lobster salad was floating in too much dressing, but the terrace is a great spot to watch the street. 
159979152	 I stayed here recently for a couple of nights on a business trip. It's about a block and a half from the McPherson Orange Line metro stop.. or .5 mile from the Metro Center Metro stop if you don't ind the walk. We were having a meeting here, but we also walked around a lot as part of the meeting. It was maybe .5 mi from the White House...<br/><br/>Check in was fast and friendly.. The room was a 2 queen/full beds, with windows on both sides on the 12th floor. The flat screen TV was well positioned, and had a good assortment of satellite channels. Bathroom toiletries were of good quality and there were plently of towels. There was a nice mini-fridge in the room.<br/><br/>One demerit..(which knocks it down to 4 stars). internet access was $12.95 a day if you so chose..(I did not) In this day &amp; age, I think that is crazy.... At least Hilton comps it if you are Gold or Diamond level... <br/><br/>Being in DC, there are dozens of eating choices within a reasonable walk... 
194570288	 Not sure this is really a crowne plaza- missing things like additional pillows/blankets in room, however overall the room product is pretty good. <br/>Bell boys not helpful at all - I had to spell my name 3 times to them to park my car the had to drag my bags up to my room without any help.<br/>Checkin was fast and efficient as expected having being part of IHG rewards and stayed at many IHG properties.<br/>With my status I was &quot;invited&quot; to join the &quot;VIP Honor Bar&quot; not sure what the honour was? I had to pay to sit there and have a drink. Not to mention the food which was some soggy spring rolls, dry cheese and celery and dip... Need I say any more? This is definitely well below par for other crowne plaza hotels I have stayed.<br/>Location is good and room comfortable however pretty sure we would have got better service at a 3 star hotel! 
194542646	 Veronica and alex were great with service. Also the suite the lady with breakfast is great. The room service and maid were awesome as well. I will be returning and never think of another hotel. They are pet friendly and even catered to our need of warmer water. I dont think it could have gotten any better than this 
194000931	 Despite scaffolding on the exterior of the Hamilton Crowne Plaza the hotel impresses on a number of fronts; inviting lobby; friendly and efficient welcome and a room that is spotlessly clean, most comfortable, and decorated to a 'wow' standard.   It is light and airy. The bed was the most comfortable of the three hotels. It has it's own Starbucks. <br/><br/>However, it has no free wi-fi. These days that's poor. <br/><br/>On a Saturday night the bar becomes a banging disco but the noise was no problem on the 10th floor. <br/><br/>It's 14K restaurant and service was very,very good and up until Saturday night the best meal we had to that point on our American trip ( pork chop, NY strip steak, seasonal veg, NY cheesecake and Ravenswood Zinfandel)<br/><br/>The following evening on our final night, before setting off for dinner, the hotel lobby enquired if they could do any more to improve the stay. By that they just did and then added a late checkout the following day. Tres bien!<br/><br/>Would not hesitate to return to this hotel. 
193358357	 I had a business trip to DC and selected this hotel so that I could walk to work. I was impressed when I arrived. The front desk staff was very pleasant and the room was lovely. The bedding was super comfortable and I was glad to see so many outlets. I hate having to unplug things so that I can charge my stuff. <br/><br/>The first night was fine. I found a hang tag in my room to order breakfast. It was delivered right on time the next morning and was very good. The next night there was no hang tag so I called to room service to request my meal for the next morning. I woke up to no hot water and my breakfast never arrived. I had to call and order another breakfast because they had lost my original order. The hot water wasn't fixed before I had to leave. I left my luggage with the bellman and went to work. When I got back they had apparently given me the wrong receipt for my luggage and had kept both parts with the number so I had to go find my luggage. It wasn't a big deal but it just added to the day's mishaps. <br/><br/>The wifi was free as a platinum member but it was so slow it was useless and kept disconnecting. <br/><br/>This hotel is lovely and much nicer than the Holiday Inn that I usually stay at when I'm visiting other DC clients. If they could just fix the customer service/facilities issues it would be great. 
192237103	 I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne primarily on a business trip, but also brought my family and did some touring/site seeing. Nicely updated rooms and it was perfect for a small business meeting as finding the meeting rooms was very convenient in the lower level, just off the main lobby. Enjoyed the bar and restaurant, the bar has nightly specials on both drinks and small plate food items. <br/><br/>The location was nicely located, only about 3-4 blocks from the White House and then a couple more to roughly the middle section of the Washington Mall. Any closer to the Capitol or White House and the room rates go way up. I also thought this was an affordable location, especially for DC. 
191622380	 Our family stayed at this hotel for 3 days. The main hall is a wonderful architectural site. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable, but lacked free wi-fi. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The breakfast (not included in our reservation) was very good although somewhat on the expensive side. Overall, the hotel is pretty and clean and the service excellent. Highly recommended. 
169773906	 Although only 3 nights here, I enjoyed both the hospitality and a great venue for the High School reunion I came to attend. Great location few blocks from the white house and short taxi rides to all the happening places in DC. The staff was very generous, friendly and very welcoming. Great food especially branch was great since they provide a wide variety of food to accommodate everybody's diet. I will always stay at this hotel - that is for sure. 
169773007	 Stayed there for a couple of days for a reunion and I had a great experience. The location was great and the staff were excellent. Totally recommended. they had good brunch as well which was a great deal. 
169641539	 My husband has Priority Club status at IHG hotels from work travel, so we chose the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for our anniversary weekend getaway. It wasn't in the budget to splurge on The Willard or Jefferson level hotels, but I wanted to feel like we were in DC and not anywhere USA. We were not disappointed, it has the feel of a real DC hotel with the old architecture, etc. (some of the chain hotels are so generic - even if modern - it begins to bother me). It being the weekend I got a very reasonable rate for a hotel in a great location for our needs. We could walk to the theater, dinner and even took a stroll over to one of the art museums. <br/><br/>We had reserved a Club level room on an upper floor, but due to being PC Gold, we were upgraded to a corner suite which was great (I know the regular rooms can be small in older hotels). The lounge was closed over the weekend, but were comped an appetizer and a breakfast in the restaurant instead. We were even sent some chocolate strawberries to our room for our anniversary from &quot;Ricardo and the front desk team&quot;. Very nice touch. Service from all the staff was great while we were there. Only con, was small elevators as others have mentioned (again, older hotel). It can be noisy in that area at night, but I guess we were high enough because it wasn't a real problem for us. Bed super comfy.<br/><br/>All in all, had a great stay. Priority Club recognition is sometimes hit and miss with IHG hotels, but The Hamilton really treated us well. 
169527093	 We stayed at this hotel for a period of 6 days during the holiday week of 4th of July. Their staff members are super nice and they included the valets, maintenance, restaurant, housekeeping, front desk and concierge. They have a nice room service menu (4 cheese pizza..mmmm) and breakfast in the morning was pleasant. <br/><br/>One of the biggest benefits to this hotel is the location. You can walk to some of the major attractions in D.C. What I found to be useful for me was the in-house Starbucks at the lobby for a quick breakfast or the crepe joint across the street for something different yet satisfying. I also needed flowers so there was a florist also located across the street and in addition, a car rental (Enterprise) around the corner of another block which made it super convenient. There are lovely restaurants around and if you like food carts, a line of them can be found during lunch time till the early evening across at Franklin Park. CVS and Macy's were also within the next few blocks for last minute essentials.<br/><br/>The beds were particularly comfortable. The bathroom although small was nicely renovated. We also had a sofa in our king room which provided us the added space. We did not have much of a view from the 11th floor (facing another building) but we truly enjoyed the décor of the room. The Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a clean, classic and comfortable hotel. I would most definitely return. This is definitely a hotel to stay when in D.C. 
169469558	 Stayed here for 3 nights in Club Room with access to the lounge area in the evenings. hotel was of the standard you expect from a Crowne Plaza - spotlessly clean, high quality staff and good food. Breakfast was pretty special (but hotel breakfasts in Washington usually are!) and the bar food (I didn't use the main restaurant) was good value too. The Lounge area was a little disappointing with a very limited selection of food and drinks on offer and in reality it was situated in a lobby area by the lifts so unsurprisingly wasn't used that much and there was little or no atmosphere there. I have enjoyed much better club lounges in IHG hotels elsewhere. I wouldn't pay the extra for this facility at this hotel again though the convenience and tranquility of the area was useful. I did receive one astonishing (by British standards at least) piece of customer service - when i asked at the reception where i could catch a bus to Georgetown i wasn't merely pointed in the direction but the member of staff came with outside me to show me precisely where the bus stop was. It was only 100 yards outside but the extra effort the lady went to was remarkable in my view and a reflection on the service ethos in this hotel (as well as in USA in general I suppose). Also a convenient Starbucks in the reception area - though not too difficult to find one of these in Washington DC! 
169445739	 We stayed at the Hamilton for our first four and then again for the last two nights of our Holidays. Both times, we were given the corner rooms. Loved both rooms, but room 744 was my favourite - quiet with a spacious bathroom and big closet!!!! We had booked room with double beds that were really comfy and heavenly. <br/>Complimentary flight check-in, printing of boarding pass facilities and Starbacks for morning coffee are located just on the left side of the reception desk.<br/>Enjoyed the Lobby area for mingling with friends and sipping coffee at any time of the day.<br/>The Hamilton staff were the icing on the cake. They made our Comboni reunion unforgettable.<br/>Will definately return to stay at the Hamilton D.C. again. For sure! 
33151671	 This hotel has a lovely entrance lobby and is quite old world - especially for the US.<br/>I had a lovely suite which was very roomy and well appointed.<br/>The restaurant has great food although it is very expensive.<br/>It is a few hundred feet from a metro station so it is extremely easy to get around from there to see the sights.<br/>There isn't a lot around the area in the evening as it is primarily a business area but I didn't find that a problem. 
32344894	 Location is good, not far from business area and the White House.<br/>Apart from that, certainly not recommanded for the following reasons :<br/>I booked on the internet for an average of USD 300 per night an &quot;executive&quot; room.<br/>The executive lounge was closed, and nobody informed me in advance about it.<br/>My room was dark , small and old, and I have no idea of how the &quot;non executive&quot; rooms can be...<br/>The bathroom was also very small, all seems to be of the 50s... In order to correctly close the curtains, a clothes pin is put on them...<br/>There is no minibar or fridge in the room. You have to rent a fridge if you want to keep in the room at least a bottle of mineral water.<br/>Despite the &quot;executive&quot; nature of the room, you have to pay for the internet.<br/>So find an alternative and dont stay there. 
31028388	 My husband and I stayed here from May 21-26. The Front Desk sfaff was very friendly, helpful and informative. We asked for a late check-out on our last day. No problem! The room and bathroom were very clean, somewhat on the small side; however, we did not spend much time there anyway. They provide you with earplugs due to the street noise! We asked housekeeping for extra coffee and they promptly delivered it. The hotel's restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The food was very good, well presented and the wait staff excellent. The location is great! It is only a short walk to the Smithonian museums and the Mall. Also there is The Circulator stop nearby for the bus to Georgetown 
30472622	 This hotel is a Historic Hotel, but does not look its age. The lobby gives a great first impression. The rooms are a little small, but very clean. There is a full service Starbucks for those who need their coffee. The price was incredibly low for a downtown hotel of this caliber. I definitely recommend. 
30390205	 I have stayed here many times before but not in the last six months. Despite DC being one of the few booming travel destinations, you wouldn't know it staying at the Hamilton. Across the board the quality of the hotel has declined, from check in to upkeep to even the towels. You will still pay a premium for the ultra convenient location, but it has slipped significantly. 
29302480	 Great hotel, location &amp; srevice. Staff was unbelievable!! 
187098202	 I will keep this simple:<br/>Great room, great rate, great location. Staff is really very kind, efficient and polite. I travel extensively and I wish I could have this hotel with me everywhere.<br/><br/>If I had to find a negative: the internet. For three days using two devices, my internet bill was almost $80! For INTERNET! Not the worst thing to happen but a serious disappointment. 
187002998	 Well located and reasonably priced business hotel in the downtown DC area not far from the White House. The breakfast was good and the staff and service quality was well above average. Very good choice for business travelers. 
186833684	 This was my first time staying at the Hamilton and oh what a pleasant surprise it was. Very clean, very classy, awesome restaurant! Front desk was extremely helpful and recognized my Priority Club status (Platinum) and was upgraded to a top floor corner suite which had amazing views of the park across the street and even the Washington monument (I will try to remember to add pictures later). I had a nice living room with a sectional couch, big LED tv, fridge, even a built-in bookshelf which really made it feel more like an apartment than a hotel. Bedroom was amazing with a very comfy bed and they even left these crimes to help me sleep. One was a facial cream (and I think it really helped), a foot crime to help relax my tired feet, and a calming/relaxing spray that made me feel like I was in a spa!<br/><br/><br/>Room service was also a pleasant treat since it came from the awesome hotel restaurant. It arrived about 20 min after I ordered, everything was hot and we'll put together.<br/><br/><br/>The hotel is situated very conveniently on the corner of 14th and K street which is really close to a ton of touristy kinds of places as well as places to eat. Starbucks is also downstairs which you can just bill to your room!!!<br/><br/><br/>No pool/spa but an a very good workout room with plenty of treadmills and bikes and even some free weights and a modern &quot;universal&quot; machine. I'll probably start staying here more often when I'm DC given the classy style yet reasonable rates and location. 
186828172	 With the amount of travel I do for work, I never get to relax at Hotels. That all changed with my stay at the Hamilton. I'm only a Basic member with their rewards program but they made me feel like a Platinum. I, especially want to thank Andre, Louis and Veronica for all the assistance they provided from arranging tours of the capital and Washington Monument to great spots for dinner to City landmarks.The staff alone make staying at this hotel a must. While the food is average and no free wifi, I couldn't have asked for a better stay on vacation for a change. 
185940827	 We stayed for 2 nights this November<br/>Recently refurbished hotel in great location in downtown Washington DC.<br/>Great tourist location for sightseeing.<br/>Room was well furnished with 2 very comfortable beds.<br/>Only small downside is that being in the centre of DC you do get a bit of traffic noise with the odd police or fire siren.<br/>The reception team were extremely helpful and assisted us on finding our way around the City.<br/>Food in the restaurant was good and breakfasts adequate for our needs.<br/>Bar is very popular with locals in the evening which makes for a great atmosphere.<br/>Would thoroughly recommend the hotel. 
185902553	 I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza while attending a conference at the Washington Convention Center and found it to be the perfect choice. The building itself (on the National Register of Historic Places) and the rooms are beautiful, the staff extraordinarily helpful and the restaurant, 14K, is excellent. The location is very convenient to the Convention Center, the White House as well as many casual and fine dining options. All in all a real treat. The only downside was what the hotel described as the &quot;upgraded&quot; television system, which seemed a downgrade to us after looking at the former selections. No PBS, for example, but plenty of Fox News. Also the picture on the large flat screen television set kept reverting to pixels or whatever you call it when the picture starts appearing as cubes or squares. Get the TV working better and the hotel will get 5 stars from me. 
228677322	 convenient location, mediocre restaurant, lack of internet access, unaccommodative and unattentive staff; regular rooms; would not recommend for business. does not care to the needs of the business traveller 
228088875	 Just a block from the Metro, this hotel is located in the central business area (14th and K Streets).<br/>It is convenient to all government buildings, the White House, and the George Washington University. Very safe to walk around the area.<br/>While it is an older building, it has been updated. The rooms, while not large, are more than adequate, and are furnished very nicely. The ammenities in the bathrooms were quite nice.<br/>There is a bar and nice (moderately priced) restaurant in the hotel. The food was good. There is also a Starbucks in the hotel.<br/>The staff was very helpful in all respects.<br/>You might want to request a room not facing 14th Street if noise might bother you; although it wasn't an issue for us, particularly on the weekend. The window coverings kept the room very dark.<br/>The room rate was fair for what you got. 
227925255	 We stayed two nights and very much enjoyed our stay. Lots of easy walking places the restaurant is nice and the staff very friendly. It is a little pricey but so is everything else in the area. I would definitely stay here again. <br/><br/>Access to the subway is also very easy. 
227520554	 I recently stayed at the Hamilton Crown Plaza with my girlfriend and was very disappointed with my experience. For starters I made my reservation on Booking.com for a park view room. When I arrived at the location, I was told that the only room they had was on the second floor and was adjacent to the park. I told them that I didn't want that room and they accommodated me with a room on the 14th floor with no park view. I was fine with that but the next morning after house keeping turned the bed we located a bed bug in the bed. The manager was notified and they moved us to another room. <br/><br/> I didn't make a big issue of the situation because of the fact that I thought they were going to accommodate me and obviously due to the health hazard reimburse me for the nights stay. Unfortunately that did not happen. When I went downstairs the next morning I spoke to the manager whom I had spoke to regarding the bed bug situation and she did not even give me complimentary parking. She just said this is what you paid on booking.com and that was that. <br/><br/> The location is great but definitely not worth the money or the aggravation. The parking is $45.00 a night which is very high. The only good point I will point out Is the bell hop and the room service was on point other than that I will NOT be staying at the Crown Plaza Hamilton.<br/><br/> I have attached a photo of the bed bug for your review. If you are going to stay at this hotel make sure you inspect the room thoroughly otherwise I would recommend you stay at a different hotel. I'm sorry but bed bugs are a health hazard and although they moved us to another room some other form of accommodation should have been met. This is unacceptable and just shows that as a business they do not care for their clients. I hope this review is helpful. 
226888371	 Stayed here for a short break in Washington. Location was fairly central, the Whitehouse being the closest landmark. Not far from bus and metro.<br/><br/>The hotel is fairly old and this is limiting in terms of facilities. Rooms although nice were very small and there was no pool. Also, no washing machine. <br/><br/>Staff were polite but distant and the tip culture was very evident with compulsory valet parking etc etc<br/><br/>I won't rush back! 
226793175	 I was booked into this hotel through work. <br/><br/>For those who need to use internet during your trip, avoid the Hamilton Crowne Plaza at all costs. Wayport provides internet here - $13 to $17 PER DAY for internet. I opted for the middle tier, $15/day, only to find that it gives speeds ranging from 0.25mbps to 1.0mbps down. The internet will drop out for an hour at a time with no way to do anything about it, and the front desk will want to make you pay a deposit for a wireless bridge if you complain. <br/><br/>$13 to $17 per day for internet. <br/><br/>I had no choice but to stay here, but you can avoid it (I hope). You should seriously avoid it until they offer free wifi like a goddamn civilised hotel. <br/><br/>Also, the iron was broken when I got here, and the mirror fell off the closet door randomly around midnight. They were somewhat responsive but they should have checked these things beforehand! 
141851000	 Stayed one night in a room on the 5th floor. Seemed to have been just renovated. Beautiful room - very tastefully done. The bed was very comfortable and I found the hotel very quiet until 7am, when the business bustle started as expected given the hotel's location.<br/><br/>I found the staff to be very friendly and attentive to detail. It was pouring in the morning and the staff was out there with umbrellas helping guests into cabs, handing out umbrellas and giving directions.<br/><br/>The only complaint is a pet peeve - which is charging for internet service. I personally think that charging $12 for internet service when the room rate is definitely not on the cheap side ($360 per night) is ridiculous. Internet should be a basic service at hotels these days, especially hotels that cater to the business traveler.. <br/><br/>Anyway, I'd stay at this Crowne Plaza again for sure. 
141429391	 Stayed here for a short business trip and was really impressed with the service and amenities of this hotel. I stayed in one of the recently renovated rooms which was extremely comfortable (great bed) and unique among hotels catering to business travelers. The location is superb and the food in hotel restaurant is delicious. To top it off, the staff is very friendly and accommodating. All in all a great experience. 
141151744	 The room I stayed was completely renovated, modern, classy and very comfortable. The bed was so comfortable that I am now on the hunt for a very similar mattress for my home. The room is furnished with all the modern conveniences - and well designed. Very clean and all of the staff members were friendly and accommodating. There is a Starbucks in the lobby and an excellent restaurant that offers tapas that are reasonably priced and you get a lot for your money. I loved the fish tacos, so much so, I had them twice :-). <br/><br/>This is the 2nd business trip where I stayed at The Hamilton and I love this hotel and highly recommend it. <br/><br/>Special shout out to Ravi, the hotel manager, who arranged a special rate for me to extend my stay (paid for personally, not the company) and also personally walked me up to my room with my bags. I highly recommend this hotel. 
141122593	 The Hamilton room extended a good corporate rate for my weekend stay.<br/>Cleanliness - The room was clean when they came - nice decor.<br/><br/>Location - It was slightly inconvenient to most of the areas that I wanted to hang out in, about a 15 min ride to U Street/Georgetown areas. However, very convenient for downtown.<br/><br/>Service - The cleaning team didn't come back to clean one night after trying to clean when I was still in the room. They knocked aggressively to ensure that we checked out on time on Sunday, which was annoying. But the staff downstairs was fantastic - went the extra mile!<br/><br/>Food - I had a lovely afternoon sipping wine and snacking on the patio at the restaurant. 
140724840	 I stayed for business purposes, however had some time to enjoy the beauty of the city (now, my favorite from the US apart from whole Hawaii's ones). <br/>This was because the staff really helped me out to plan what to see, where to buy, what to expect... And the food is really good, speciacially the morning's buffet plenty with great options. And a plus: right inside the building, am exclusive entry to a Starbucks ;)<br/><br/>The rooms are really comfy and modern but classy. <br/><br/>But the best part was the location, in the middle of the area where the White House, the Smithsonian museums and the Washington monument are. 
140347821	 The Hamilton is a grand hotel in a fantastic location just off K street in DC. <br/><br/>Staff were very friendly and professional. <br/><br/>My biggest issue was that the room was somewhat outdated and VERY noisy (despite asking for a quiet room). This made sleeping quite uncomfortable. Also, the sink was outside the bathroom and part of the room (i.e with the moquette, etc...). Quite odd. 
147448624	 This is a lovely historic hotel, beautifully restored, and I had high expectations. I stayed here for four nights during a business trip, in two different rooms. <br/><br/>The rooms I stayed in were recently renovated, clean and comfortable. The front desk and lobby staff were all very professional, and there is a nice restaurant plus a Starbucks in the building. The location is great, within walking distance to plenty of sights, bars and restaurants. <br/><br/>The first room had a serious draft coming in the window, making it very cold by the window and hot in the rest of the room because the thermostat, also by the window, continually kicked on in an effort to moderate the temperature. Since I arrived exhausted, at night, I just huddled under the covers and tried to be comfortable till morning.The hotel comped my breakfast without being asked, which I appreciated.<br/><br/>The next room was much better but had ongoing problems with the television. I had a technician in the room every day, trying to get the cable to stay tight. Ultimately they could make the digital channels come in clearly but not the analog, and the cable is very sensitive. I had the impression this was a problem in much of the building.<br/><br/>Despite these glitches I recommend this hotel to the business or pleasure traveler, keeping in mind there may be occasional glitches to deal with. 
147396903	 Meticulous restoration of a charming deco gem. We were pleasantly surprised ... did not expect to be blown away - but we were ... hotel is just lovely. Stunning deco glass entry, gorgeous marble lobby, large/immaculate/beautifully decorated guest suite (executive floor), nice executive center (breakfast and evening appetizers served) and a really, really friendly and efficient staff. We go to DC quite often for business and have stayed at a few other hotels in the area ... this one beats them all ... Fabulous! 
147148002	 I throughly enjoyed my stay at the Crown Plaza in D.C. It is in a great position within walking distance to all the attractions and public transport. The rooms were spacious and the beds were very comfortable. The service i received was great, all the staff were more then happy to help. The concierge Lewis was definitely a stand out employee and was one of the most helpful and knowledgeable  people I have encountered on my travels. My only criticism would be that there is no free WIFI at this hotel and it costs $17 per device for 24 hours. However, I would be more than happy to recommend this hotel to anyone and If I was to come back to D.C I would stay here again. 
146917857	 This was the worst Hotel experience I have ever had. I arrived there late Friday night after a long day of work. When I arrived they told me that I would have to pay a hidden $75 which was not on my confirmation page. which paid for the bar for internet and other things that are usually complimentary. They also said these fee were nonrefundable. They also told me that I would have to pay a Valet Fee of $45. I told them I don't want to pay extra on top of my $160 for one night in dc. When I arrived in the room it is the smallest one I had ever seen especially for the price. When I paid for the reservation I made sure that it included breakfast. When we woke up we ask where the breakfast is served and they pointed us in that direction. When we finished eating they told us we didnt pay for it and it would cost us $50. After an hour of talking to the front desk they than said it was because we ate brunch. Every moment we were there it looked like it cost us. I think if they could have charged us for going down the elevator they would have. The only good Experience I had at this hotel is when they stopped holding my key and finally let us go. 
146523721	 The staff was nice, the breakfast was fine, and the rooms were decent. The hotel is situated near the white house and other good sights. The fitness room was also ok for this size of hotel.<br/>how many more signs do you need? 
145988193	 I stayed here on a business trip to DC. It was a great trip was a great hotel. It had great staff. It has a great bar. It was a great restaurant. Overall clean room great hotel I would say here again. I really have nothing bad to say about this hotel. The room was just overall great. Bed was comfortable. I'm just trying to kill 200 esters 
196616149	 Stayed for 3 nights while travelling on business. The hotel is well located and it was convenient for my work.<br/>The standard room I had was small, the bathroom was very tiny and looked old. But generally speaking the rooms were clean and comfortable. <br/>It is important to mention that wifi service did not work very well, and it disturbed my work. I also had other technical problems in the room, it was not possible to use landline phone. And it could not be fixed for some reasons.<br/>The staff was very good, check in and check out went very fast, they were all very helpful with looking for some information and advising about sightseeing, shopping etc . 
196335850	 Mu husband and I just spent 3 nights at this hotel in a standard room and was very pleased. Had read earlier reviews here and was concerned about the noise issue so requested higher floor (on 11th). Never a problem. Another couple we were with on 2nd floor also had no problems with noise. Was the room small? Well we've been in bigger but also much smaller rooms in our years of traveling. Plenty of room to move about. Also well equipped-we had a comfortable queen size bed, desk, 2 chairs, safe, refrigerator, good size closet, full length wall mirror, well stocked and roomy bathroom. Everything has been renovated. Did not eat there. Check in and out went smoothly and every staff member we dealt with were pleasant and helpful. It's winter now and the heating system was just fine. <br/>By the way, if you want free wifi just sign up in advance for their club membership-it's free. Worked fine. <br/>All in all a very good experience. 
196137253	 The Hamilton Crowne Plaza Hotel is in an excellent location, offers great food, location and the beds lend to a peaceful night's sleep. The Hotel's decor is well appointed in great taste. Very appealing to traveler's from all walks of life. 
196029944	 The location is excellent for many reasons and near the metro. We didn't bother with a car knowing the metro, taxis and our feet would suffice. The room was clean, possible recently redone and large. The Starbucks on property is very convenient and the food we had in the bar was better than I'd expected. My two negatives about the Hamilton were: 1. Three hotel staff standing in the doorway talking as our taxi pulled up. They watched as I lugged my suitcase up the stairs and then offered to roll it across the lobby the 15 feet to the front desk…um, no thanks. 2. $12.95 for internet connection per day/per device. Rip-off. Even the front desk said it could be unreliable in the rooms. You have internet, you are charging for the room - include internet access. 
195146974	 Stayed here 1 night on a Saturday. Located north of Mall and convenient to many places in DC. Subway is a block away. Park across he street. North on 14th Street are a number of restaurants and shops. Starbucks on ground floor. Hotel bar/restaurant is inexpensive and tasty. The only drawbacks were that parking overnight was $45 when there are several decks I saw after-the-fact that are charging $11/overnight. They also charge for Wi-Fi, but you can typically pick-up free Wi-Fi in DC anyway. Several restaurants and pubs nearby and a CVS for any items that you may need is a block away. Beautiful historic building and lobby. Rooms are fairly decent size, clean and not too noisy. All-in-all a pleasant experience. 
194760657	 I had booked this hotel for the MCM, and the staff was very accomodating. The hotel is in an area with great access. The only problem I had was that the room definitely smelled like smoke even though I had requested a non-smoking room. It was perfect for getting to the race in 15-20 minutes though, and that's what I needed 
226369474	 Great location. You can walk to most of the D.C historical sites and museums and the METRO location is one of the area's best they say. Staff were very friendly and helpful. A nice restaurant is on site. The rooms were clean and modern even though this is a historical building. Only down side is the nightly rates are high. 
226143646	 Great place to stay for visiting the White House and surrounding areas. Good sized rooms and well presented with all amenities id expect being a Platinum member. Spacious clean rooms and close to all you need to see 
225903319	 Excellent hotel. Great food in 14K restaurant. Very central and only 1 block from McPherson Metro Station. Very friendly and helpful staff. Very safe feeling around this hotel. Lovely park across the road. Only drawback was all the sirens during the night. 
225735644	 Stayed here for a weekend in Washington. Great hotel. Walking distance to White House etc. Hasn't got much in the hotel apart from a Starbucks and a cute bar/restaurant which we had a drink at but didn't eat. There are lots of choice for breakfast around the hotel so we brought up crepes, tea and some fruit from the cvs 2 mins up the road. Room was lovely, great big bed (a little hard compared to some we have stayed in but spends on your taste!) they left little spa kits in the room which I thought was a great touch! I definitely would recommend it. 
225393740	 When you enter the beautiful lobby of this historic hotel, you get a really good feeling. This hotel has great location, it is pretty close to National Mall &amp; Museums. The hotel is clean and quite. The rooms are small but well provisioned. The wifi is paid and they charge you per device-wise, which is pretty painful in today's era. Its is nice hotel to stay, if you want to see Washington's attractions. 
224888481	 I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in June. The hotel was beautiful. I loved the historic details inside and out. The Hamilton is in a great location to walk to the White House or the Mall or reach a close-by Metro stop. The lobby was elegant and finely appointed. The hotel room was high quality, quiet, cool, and comfortable. I recommend this hotel for a visit to Washington, DC. 
247769320	 I stayed here for New Years Eve and it was my first time to the area. The hotel was clean, modern, beautiful and convenient to everything. The room was clean and modern as well. Very happy with my choice to stay here and I am looking forward to staying here again when I return in the spring. I hope the price stays the same! 
246421961	 This hotel offered a wonderful stay during the Holiday Season! The rate was superb considering all the amenities, the beauty of the room and convenience to every where we visited while in DC. We took advantage of the package that included valet parking and breakfast, which was excellent!<br/>We were unable to turn our television on before dinner, but once we returned the problem had been addressed and we were able to watch a movie before going to sleep. The bed has to be one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on while in a hotel!<br/>I would suggest this hotel to any of my friends making a visit to the DC area! 
245568189	 The staff was very nice and helpful at the Hamilton Crowne. The room was very clean, spacious, and the beds were comfortable. The hotel is in close vicinity to metro stops and many popular attractions are in walking distance, including the White House. 
245279360	 Great location, easy to get around. Close enough to convention center to walk, but also close to public transit. Bar in the hotel. Word to the wise, the elevators are nice but they can take a long time, so be sure to account for a bit of a wait if you are staying on a high floor. 
244548054	 Got an excellent deal on Hotwire! Everyone made my family feel extra special. Especially Alex! The room is small but very nice and has a space for everything. The restaurant is delicious and the Starbucks is very convenient. We walked to all the major attractions. My children loved the hotel and would definitely return. The WiFi is free for IHG members otherwise not worth the cost. 
244395573	 Immediately upon arrival the staff makes it clear they are there for YOU. The lobby is small but it takes 10 steps to find whatever beverage you'd like after fighting with DC traffic. Our room was just off the elevator on the 8th Floor (another Hotwire hookup) but it mattered not. The room was spacious, very quiet, and nicely appointed. The beds were some of the most comfortable anywhere. So why not an excellent rating? The glass covers on all the furniture tops were dusty! Seems like a minor point, but ... I suspect most of you know what I mean. 
244247243	 I paid USD 600 for 2 nights for a fairly small room and small double bed which is quite expensive. On the plus side, the decor was nice and the quality of bed linen was excellent. The free (any) drink for platinum IHG status was really nice and the food excellent although the tuna sashimi was killed by the intense pepper heat from the coating. I love spicy food but this ruined an excellent piece of tuna in my opinion 
243774104	 The Hamilton Crowne Plaza possesses the classy elegance of an old luxury hotel, with the conveniences of a modern inn, convenient to the sites and experiences that DC has to offer. Stayed for three nights in December. We were able to walk to many sites, restaurants, etc. Taxis and Ubers plentiful and readily available. <br/>The staff was delightful and accommodating. I can understand the positive reputation it holds, and the reason for so many highly rated reviews. We will definitely return! 
243771226	 I visit DC on business periodically. I love the Hamilton. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. The rooms are sound-insulated better than other hotels I have stayed at. The location is great, both for business and for visiting the Smithsonian and monuments. One can often get a good rate through the IHG site. Don't be fooled--this is not a discount hotel in any way, shape, or form. It is far superior to various Hiltons, Westins, and Marriotts in town. The only comparable hotel at which I have stayed is the Willard, which usually is simply too expensive. 
242510685	 Spent Thanksgiving weekend with the family at this hotel. The rooms were spacious and nicely furnished and appointed. The location was terrific - in the heart of downtown and walking distance to most of the major museums, monuments and major attractions. The staff was friendly and professional. And there was a nice little Starbucks in the lobby. This is an older hotel but it is nicely maintained. 
242090057	 We had a great time staying here. The Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a beautiful historic building. The staff are friendly and the hotel and rooms were clean, modern and comfortable. The metro is only a 5 minute walk. There are lots of restaurants in the area. 
241623515	 Hamilton is centraly located, well known to most taxi drivers, and wish you a warm welcome as you arrive. And it lasts thru the week. The rooms are comfortable and clean, the gym is open 24/7 and may give you a good start/end of the day, and the breakfast is great (albeit slightly overpriced). Recommended! 
212111172	 we had a double room, with two beds, it was very clean, and our housekeeping did the same job the next day! They had great customer service, valet was $45 per day however it was very convenient. Our iron was not working, but that's the ONLY negative ! 
212090419	 Just returned from 5 night stay at CP Hamilton Washington DC and can't say enough about how nice the staff was, as well as the room itself. We had room 841 overlooking Franklin Park, no complaints other than all the sirens in the city (which you hear no matter which hotel/room you stay in). The hotel lobby and room were very clean and cozy. We ate dinner 3 nights out of 5 at the hotel's restaurant...it was that good. The cost of eating there was not cheap, but unless you eat at a sandwich shop or fast food you'll pay about the same price or even more at surrounding establishments. Again, the wait staff at restaurant was super nice and accommodating. The hotel is within walking distance to many of the museums/Lincoln Memorial/Wash. Monument/ White House. We took the Metrorail to the zoo, Holocost Museum, and for reaching Union Station, the hub for Big Bus Tour. We would definitely stay here again! 
211941506	 I stayed here for 4 nights in May 2014. The Hamilton is a beautiful blend of history and elegance. My room was very spacious, with 2 double beds, a view on to the park opposite, a large, well-lit desk and work space and a big bathroom with bathtub, shower and high quality toiletries. Daily room cleaning was faultless and staff were always pleasant, friendly and professional. The hotel's restaurant, 14K, is really good and there are plenty of dining options just 10 minutes walk away, along K Street. The Hamilton is also walking distance from The White House and the McPherson Square train station is half a block away. The lobby is large and elegant and the bar is justifiably very popular with guests and locals. I will definitely choose Hamilton next time I'm in Washington. 
211935272	 Location was great. The good ended there for me. Worst hotel stay ever. Even before getting to the hotel I couldn't get a single front desk clerk to get my room right. My husband and I were bitten by bugs in the room and there were blood stained sheets. I requested a deep cleaning for the room and when we returned to What was supposed to be a cleaned room they hadn't even changed the sheets. Just made the bed with the same blood stained sheets still on the bed. The bathtub was clogged up, the iron leaked water all over my blouse. After calling front desk, waited for over two hours and no one would respond to our room. Had to go to front desk before someone would do anything... only two out of four elevators were working. Seriously, I read a lot of these reviews and rarely if ever have i written one. Completely and totally disappointing especially for a Crowne Plaza. Quite frankly has me really thinking twice about IHG properties overall. In my experience as a traveler, these kind of problems happen from the top down. Would I stay here again? No Way... 
211915197	 We stayed for 4 nights at the Hamilton and were very pleased. The room on the third floor didn't have a view (but who comes to DC to look out a window?), but it was very spacious and well appointed. The location is fantastic. It's walking distance to the White House and the McPherson Square metro is only 2 blocks away. We loved having a Starbucks connected to the lobby for a quick breakfast before we set off to sightsee. There is a Walgreens 2 blocks away and lots of lunch options on 14th St. as well. Staff was helpful and accommodating. Don't order room service meals--very pricey and not flavorful. Overall, it was an excellent stay and we would definitely stay here again. 
211821213	 I loved this hotel, was really well decorated and the rooms were so comfortable and had plenty of room. All the monuments, museums and the White House were all in walking distance.<br/>Certainly worth the money! 
239321545	 Recently my organization held a conference for 400+ people at this hotel and highly recommend them for many reasons for either a stay or a conference. Though it is a small hotel they have access to a conference center next door that makes it all work very well. The best thing about the Hamilton is the excellent staff and service--all the people we have worked with are helpful and so caring, watching over every detail, dealing with every crisis smoothly. Sales Manager, Gus Mardini is the very best we have ever worked with and is a true professional.<br/>Nancy with Shared Hope International 
238909348	 I was there 3 days for a conference. The hotel was very nice and staff were very accommodating. The food in the restaurant was good, though expensive. They also had nice prices in happy hour drinks 4-9pm. I really liked having the Starbucks right downstairs. My room was large and comfortable. The amenities were nice with a robe, earplugs, yoga mat, umbrella and aromatherapy sleep spray and lotions in addition to the usual items. I had free wifi but I'm also an iHg member. The elevators were a bit small and took a while to come but I liked the security feature of needing a key card to use them. There were several good restaurants in walking distance. The conference set up was a bit awkward with us having to go back and forth (and outside) between the hotel and Sphinx club around the corner for sessions. The Sphinx club had a nice ballroom for the keynote and lunch, but some of the other rooms were awkward or small and seemed to fluctuate between freezing and hot and stuffy. The lunch provided at the conference was basic but good- tasty sandwiches. I would stay again, though I'm not sure I'd recommend having a conference there. 
238875372	 My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights while exploring Washington. The location of the hotel is ideal for this : a few hunderd meters away from the Metro and within walking distance of the Mall and the main tourist attactions. There are plenty of restaurants arount the hotel, and we had some good meals in the neighborhood. The hotel itself is very clean, well maintained and has a classic look. Our room was spacious, clean and had everything we needed. Two admissions : as IHG Gold Member I had the benefit of free WiFi during my stay, and the speed of it was excellent, and as we were using a rented car, we handed in the car to the rental company at the start of our stay and took a taxi to the airport at the end, thus saving the expensive parking charges (the taxi to the airport works out to 1.5 day of parking). But hte greatest asset of this hotel are it's people. I regularly travel, but have seldomly stayed in a hotel where all members of staff are this helpful and friendly. I would definitely return here for a next visit to Washington ! 
238778651	 I had a horrible experience with this hotel. It started with check in...I arrived at 1:30 and was told that I could not check in. I supplied my phone number and was told they would call me when a room was ready. Thankfully they held onto my bags for me. I walked around for about 3 hours (Getting stuck in the rain as my umbrella was in my checked in bag) and never got a call. Upon arrival back at the hotel I was told that my room still was not ready but they could put me in a room with a queen bed (I was still charged for a king). The floor in the bathroom was dingy and My TV was broken and only got 3 channels. The engineer came to check it and told me that he had to replace the TV in order to fix it and would do so upon check out. In the morning when I went to iron my dress, the iron did not work. I was attending a conference at the hotel that began at 8AM and asked the front desk if I could check out on my lunch break at noon. To that I was told no. Again thankfully they held my bags until the conference was done for the day. I basically paid for a king room (I got a Queen) with no TV and no Iron for about 14 hour access to the room....Will never return.<br/><br/>The location was nice and easy to get to/from the airport on the blue metro line. The doormen were nice and the night crew helpful. 
238753289	 Reminds me of well appointed European hotels. The rooms are small as well as the lobby, yet very clean and nicely expensive finished appearance. However if you want large amercian rooms may not be the place for you. <br/>Staff always cleaning and available - great service in hotel and restaurant. 
237830940	 Most everything is within walking distance. Kind of funky hotel. Staff is very kind and professional. Never had any problems. Large guest rooms and bathrooms...all very nice and clean. Lobby bar and restaurant had a half price happy hour, which I mistakenly took part in. I'm not a foodie, but this was very poor, even at half price I wouldn't recommend the happy hour food.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite places to stay in DC. I stay here 2 to 3 times per year. It's about 15 minutes / $20 from National Airport by taxi. The metro link is a ways away, however it's a great way to get around DC. 
165863963	 I spent a week at the Crowne for D.A.R. Congress. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the professional and friendly staff, the beautiful decor, the large rooms with the most comfortable beds, and a superb restaurant. The staff members for both the hotel and the restaurant were top-notch: friendly, helpful, patient....attended functions at other hotels during the week and returned to Crowne each day even MORE impressed! All the ladies from the other states agreed that the Crowne Plaza is definitely the place to stay. We will return in 2014 to the Crowne and cannot wait. Thank you all staff members for making our staff memorable. Please keep the bone in rib-eye on the menu! Cindy Rice.....Laurel, MS 
165654813	 I stayed two nights for business at the Hamilton. This is a beautifully <br/>updated historic hotel in a prime location in downtown DC, bordering Franklin Square. Although I did not have much time for sightseeing, I was within easy walking distance of the White House and the National Mall. The hotel is one block from a metro stop on the blue line from National Airport, so it it by convenient for air travelers. Staff were very friendly and helpful. My room was spacious and beautifully appointed. I would gladly stay here again. 
165409839	 I had a fantastic experience with the Hamilton Crowne Plaza Hotel! A friend of mine was getting married and her and her fiance planned on staying at this hotel the night of their wedding because this is where they stayed the night they got engaged. I was responsible for setting up the hotel so I called the Front Desk to coordinate dropping off their bags prior to their arrival. Joseph from the Front Desk called me back promptly and was able to help me by offering an early check in the day of the wedding. He met me at the front desk at 8:00am and walked me up to the room. To my surprise, Joseph was able to upgrade the room to a one-bedroom suite on the top floor. Joseph and his team really went above and beyond to make sure that their day was truly special, thank you so much!!! 
165250751	 We arrived at 1am and the front desk attendants were very welcoming. The rooms were super clean, dimly lit, and classical music welcomed us. The amenities were high end and I loved the convenience of the Starbucks downstairs. It was super quiet despite being downtown. I highly recommend this hotel. 
164966561	 A wonderfully restored elegant hotel. Excellent service. Like anywhere else room service outrageously overpriced! Wonder ful srchitecture in the are. Conveniently located to White House and Metro station.<br/> 
164910414	 I'm Gold Priority Club, so I see more than my share of Crowne Plaza's (Gold Marriott, too). The Hamilton Crowne Plaza offers a good DC location. Central to most things. They have a nice cafe, bar and an attached Starbucks. The negatives: Rooms are small (Euro-sized) and, to save a few pennies, the management was not running central air in the hallways on the room floors (pretty lame). Could rate better, but they earn a average mark from me. 
175839553	 The Hamilton offers service and style that takes me back to an earlier, more gracious time, but also supplies today's necessary support for our techie addictions. I stayed on the top floor, which did not have the problem with street noise but did have a noisy air conditioner. The room was beautifully decorated and very clean. Staff was very helpful. Breakfast on the 12th floor was limited to grains--pastries, for example--and fruit. With a requirement for gluten-free foods, I was left with little choice. It is very convenient to the Washington Conference Center, so while I needed a car for other business in Vienna, most would not need the car and could avoid the $45 per night parking fee. I noticed there is a Zipcar stand nearby, so members could use this service and avoid a normal rental. All in all, a very nice hotel with great staff. 
175751176	 This hotel is decorated very nice. I loved our room decor. It was straight out of Ballard Deigns. I'm now on a quest to find the roman shades and wallpaper that were in our room and bathroom. The alarm clock had a dock for Iphones which came in handy when trying to charge three phones. USB ports would have been nice.<br/><br/>We were traveling with my parents and the front desk put us in adjoining rooms.<br/><br/>The location was close to the White House and monuments. We walked to those then caught a Big Bus Tours bus to travel to other things.<br/><br/>Andre - the concierge - was very helpful and super nice. He booked a night tour for us that was amazing.<br/><br/>The noise from outside was unbelievable. The outside bar across the street was loud and you could hear voices/screaming up to two in the morning. Add the sirens and road noise and it was awful. There was no exhaust fan in the bathroom and the shampoo/conditioner/lotion smelled bad. I'm not picky about my shampoo so for simplicity I use the hotels - this stuff was terrible. My hair was a smelly, tangled, frizzy mess. We were on the 7th floor - rooms 733 &amp; 734.<br/><br/>We had two double size beds. We have a queen at home and whatever extra room that allows is a must. My girls, ages 10 and 15 who are small girls were also complaining.<br/><br/>We booked through Delta Vacations so even though we drove we parked at the airport to avoid the $45 a night parking charge. We paid $75 for three days at the airport. We had to book a &quot;trip&quot; with Delta Vacations so we booked our room and transfers from/to the airport. <br/><br/>We were very pleased with our stay. 
175705206	 Enjoyed a wonderful experience at this hotel with my husband and children. The hotel is very clean, staff was so helpful and we enjoyed the restaurant and bar. They have a great happy hour from 4-7 and a cute outside patio area off the restaurant. The metro is 2 short blocks away! This hotel is convenient to everything. We will definately be back! 
175601804	 the location is great. The rooms were comfortable but we had to turn off the noisy air conditioner.<br/>The lobby has a large table where guests will sit to have their Starbuck's takeout!<br/>Their concierge Andre Barbiteau was friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. 
175561033	 Everything we expected from a Crowne Plaza hotel and more! Friendly staff, clean and elegantly decorated rooms, great restaurant in hotel with a Starbucks to boot! The only minor glitch was that every morning (3am) of our stay there seemed to be motorcycles drag racing up and down our street! Woke us out of a dead sleep. However, the hotel had nothing to do with this.Very pleased with our entire stay- we will be back! 
175532619	 We made a last minute decision to go to Washington, D.C. and our usual hotel didn't have a room available so we chose the Crown Plaza Hamilton because it was in the same general location and had good reviews.<br/><br/>We were pleasantly surprised by the great accommodations especially at the modest price we paid. The room, although on the small side, was recently redecorated and had all of the comfort features. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel offered a nice bar and dining room with a full buffet breakfast in the morning or a Starbucks as a breakfast alternative.<br/><br/>The hotel is just a few short blocks to the White House, Lafayette Park, and within walking distance for the Mall and all of the major monuments and museums. 
116673354	 Great location. This was a 10 minute cab ride from Reagan National. Everything was well maintained in this historic hotel. Everyone working there was very friendly and attentive. Rooms had everything we needed. We were about a 5 block walk from the White House, several monuments and several museums. The highlight was our proximity to dinner at the Old Ebbitt Grill. We will definitely be back. *Bonus* There is a Starbucks in the hotel for those of us who have a coffee habit! 
116431155	 I was very surprised to find that this hotel was rated in the bottom half of DC hotels. The Hamilton Crowne Plaza is a beautiful, historic hotel in a great location. It is within walking distance of everything. We walked to the convention center, U Street, even Adams Morgan. The hotel is small, which we loved, because it wasn't overwhelming. Other guests were having a party down the hall from us, which we could hear in the hall, but not in the room. Every employee was extremely helpful. Our only complaint is that the elevators are tiny...they hold about 4 people. Luckily there are 4 of them. 
116321903	 I went for business. Hotel was easy to find. Right on the corner. Really good location. My conference was only 2 blocks from the hotel. Valet was very nice. $40.( I've spent more i.e in New York). My husband and I walked literally everywhere. It was easier and good exercise. Close to the White House and the National Mall &amp; all the museums. I used the gym once. Pretty good facility (clean). My husband and I had the facility to ourselves. Starbucks is down stairs. Dining (14K). My food was yummy. The soup OMG....Butternut squash...I have yet to find one that comes close. I was worried about the noise but it didn't bother me. Rooms a little small but clean and cozy. Enjoyed my time there. 
116132003	 I had never heard of the Hamilton, but it's a historic hotel and and has a great location. It's only 1 block from the McPherson Metro stop, and just a few blocks from the White House. Our family of 5 had reserved through Hotwire at a rate of $189/night. When checking in, I told the front desk clerk my youngest would be sleeping on an inflatable air mattress and he helped me get a larger room on the Executive Level. During the summer, there's nothing extra offered on this floor. But we did need to swipe our room key in the elevator to access the 12th floor, which my kids thought was totally cool.<br/><br/>Our room was big and the bathroom was really large, after our stays in Boston &amp; New York City just days before. It was really nice, too, granite &amp; tile. The room had a view of the park below and the Washington Monument. Better yet, the room had blackout blinds and a clip so no pesky sunlight would bother us before we were ready to wake up! We're not a family of early birds!<br/><br/>The Concierge &amp; bellmen were great. They helped us get a monuments after dark tour, although most of the good ones were already sold out. We got a 2nd rate tour (Zohery Tours - blah!), but at least we weren't just sitting in our hotel room watching Disney Channel reruns.<br/><br/>The Starbucks off the lobby was PACKED early in the morning, but it was a reasonably fast and easy breakfast before heading out for museums. The most happening place in the hotel was the bar, which was rocking and packed each afternoon. I think there was a convention in town and lots of people chilling out.<br/><br/>The valet parking was a bit expensive, but probably about average for DC. They were fast and helpful in getting our bags in and out of the vehicle.<br/><br/>I'd stay again &amp; would love to come back with more time to explore. 
116092844	 We were in DC for combination of business and family/friends and spent three nights at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza, which I found on Kayak, listed as the LEAST expensive in DC over the weekend - $99 a night Fri thru Sunday! (reg weekday rate $238). The location is great - 14th &amp; K - a block or so from the Metro, centrally located, and on the Connection Bus line that goes around downtown for $1.<br/>I joined the Priority Club when I made reservation (directly thru hotel's website. Unexpectedly, it gave us an upgrade to high floor and a choice of free internet or half price for continental breakfast - we took the internet, and breakfast was inexpensive and good anyway.<br/>Check in at reception was wonderful - can't remember her name (Eciea?) and reservation mgr Simone. Concierges were great (Michelle &amp; Innocent). Day person, Michelle knew a great deal about sites to see and how, and Innocent, the evening shift person, was very helpful in recommending restaurants in the area and made sure we were treated royally when he made ours. Room was comfortable, very clean, and with great view of the park. (I always love finding chocolate on the pillow!)<br/>We brought food that we didn't eat on the plane but no fridge in the room. One call to operator (they were always very friendly &amp; helpful - Tamara &amp; Michelle) and Tony came up in minutes with a fridge which fit perfectly into a cabinet. (I thought they should just leave fridges in each room, except perhaps for waste of electricity when it's on 24/7 but not used.)<br/>We were glad to see card to be left on bed indicating not to change sheets daily. They should also have sign in bathroom to hang towels that don't need to be washed, but we mentioned it to housekeeping and only those towels on the floor were replaced.<br/>Dinner is a deal, especially between 4-7pm - low price for drinks and appetizers, and free bottle of wine if you order two mains! But don't expect that if you order at 7:01 as waiter's computer can't access lower prices. (The maitre d', Sadeh, however, did offer us the wine bottle even tho we missed the happy hour cutoff but we went for a bunch of delicious hors d'oerves instead and wine by the glass. We were three generations for dinner and we each found it to our liking.<br/>I believe in unions for the sake of low paid workers, and hotels are notorious for refusing to allow collective bargaining. Sadly, this hotel is non-union as are most every one in Wash DC. But when I asked the housekeeper sup she said they get health insurance, sick leave, decent pay and other bennies, so it's not terrible.<br/>I used the (small but adequate) fitness center every morning and it was fine for tread mill and weight workout. I wish they had a pool, but didn't expect one.<br/>So over all, I rate this hotel experience a great one, and I would certainly go right back there on my next DC trip. And this is the way we were treated even though the GM was on vacation all week! See photos for tips of what to see in DC.<br/>Martin 
115917984	 I stayed here 6 nights while on a business trip. The third evening, the air conditioning broke, and it was 80 degrees in the room. I called the front desk and asked for a different room...they sent someone up to check the A/C around 12:30 am when I called them. They could not fix it, and the hotel was full. I insisted they find a room and told them I am a business woman on a business trip and needed to shower in the morning and dry my hair in a cool room. They sent up a fan. Oh boy--that did not make it cooler. At approximately 3:00 am, after I called them the second time around 1:30 am or 2:00 am, they called me and said they were going to send someone up with a key to another room where I could move to. Really? at 3:30 am I'm going to move? Well, of course, I could not go back to sleep, so I went to the room and rested and then showered in the morning. What an experience! I was exhausted the next day. I moved all my things to the cool room after work the following evening after I had worked 12 hours. Not a great experience. 
206230303	 A nice hotel but 2 out of 4 elevators didn' work, We had to wait like 20 min to got down to the Lobby, also one day We arrive at 4:30 pm to the hotel and the room wasn't clean yet. It' s an expensive hotel, and I don't think the service is good at all. 
206144842	 Super hotel, nice location at walking distance from The White House (15min) and close to metrostop (2min), excellent service (our fridge didn't work and was replaced immediately), cosy restaurant, very friendly staff ... Certainly worth to try ! Our room was rather large with 2 double beds, bathroom more than big enough with bath and shower. Flatscreen tv in the room, newspaper delivery every day. Quiet room, no noise from neighbours. 
205540503	 I stayed at this hotel in mid-April for a business meeting on NY Ave. The hotel is well located with respect to good foodie restaurants (up the 14th St corridor) and the metro (McPherson Sq is 5 min. walk). The desk and lobby staff were pleasant and helpful enough. The rooms are a bit small and worn. My room was small by downtown DC standards and appointed with minimalist furniture. The main problem was the house staff. I was walked in on without knocking on three different occaisions, twice by a maid and once by the maid supervisor checking on the maid's work. One of those occasions, I was barely clad. For the money, I would go over to the Marriott a couple of blocks east and south two blocks if I was returning to this part of the city. 
205378586	 I think the room was great and I loved that it was right in the middle of everything. It certainly made using the public transportation easy. There are three bus stops at the corner of this hotel. The Circular bus is what we used the entire weekend (was only there for the Womens Nike race. The start line was a few blocks away. The bus is only a $1 per trip and was much cheaper than the subway (metro). The staff was friendly, but the elevator was broken the entire weekend. First I should say the elevator states the maximum load is 8, which is already small. but when you put luggage in there, you can barely hold 3. The smallest elevators i have ever seen. My linen closet is bigger than the elevators there. Secondly, they would not function properly. We were on the tenth floor and at one point the maid told us to take the stairs because it would &quot;be a while&quot;. When the elevator did decide to move it would stop at every floor no matter what. It was just not funcitoning properly. This occured no matter the time of day. For such a nice hotel and such a nice price tag, the issue with the elevator should have been corrected on the first day. We left 3 days later, it was still broken. 
205238166	 This hotel far exceeded our expectations. It's an older hotel that's been beautifully and thoughtfully renovated. Our room was a tad small by modern standards, but comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. It was the service, however, that really distinguished this hotel. Everything was spotless, and everyone was polite and accommodating. The concierge, Tony Brown, not only made a perfect recommendation for dinner, he walked with us halfway across the park to make sure we got there ok. Even the doorman was warm, friendly, and a great conversationalist. All in all one of the most pleasant hotel experiences I've had in DC, and at a reasonable price too. I'll definitely be back. 
204930904	 The stay was fine, room was clean, location good, K14 restaurant has wonderful food. <br/>The only thing is that when we checked out early morning, we asked for a taxi to the airport, the doorman automatically put our luggage into this black SUV, and it doesn't have taxi sign or taxi meter on it, I was pretty suspicious and asked the doorman again, he reassured us that it is a taxi, luckily at the time, there's another taxi (with taxi sign) pulled over and told us don't take the black SUV, because it is a limo service and will over charge us, then we learnt that black SUV will charge anywhere between $25 - $45 to the National Airport which normal taxi ride should only be around $16. The taxi driver told us later that the black SUV usually have agreement with the doorman, and give them money for each deal they can get. We are very disappointed with the hotel as they allow or endorse this kind of service, and I can't believe that the doorman just chuck our luggage into the fake taxi and tell us it is the taxi.. he thinks he can fool us.. this is unacceptable from a hotel like Crown Plaza. 
3844756	 We stayed at this wonderful place September 1st for 1 night. We had 3 rooms for 2 families. The rooms are over sized. The beds were sooooo comfortable, All the little extras to help you sleep were a nice addition. <br/><br/>The best part of this hotel was the location. We walked to the white house for our tour and then walked all over the place visiting museums. At the end of the day when we were tired we took the subway back. The subway is just 2 blocks from the hotel.<br/><br/>The valet parking was easy. You have in and out priviledges so if you need to drive anywhere it doesn' cost extra.<br/> 
3799244	 The Hamilton Crowne Plaza was a good choice for my family of four. The room as everyone has mentioned is compact sized but comfortable and very nicely decorated. It was clean and the beds were comfortable. Best of all was the easy walking distance to the White House and Mall. The walk to the Mall was a little more tiring but do-able. The metro is close by and easy to use. The hotel restauarant has a great lounge menu that is less expensive and quite good. The downside of this location was that on the weekend you have very little choice as far as restaurants open in the immediate hotel area. My advice is to eat where ever you find a restaurant before heading back to the hotel. During the week there are plenty of food choices. We enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again. The hotel has valet parking for $28. per 24 hour period. Eventhough it is pricey it is worth not having to deal with parking elsewhere. 
3792498	 I called asking information about the hotel, the front desk person was horribly rude. When i was connected to reservations, the lady was also very rude when answering my questions. I booked it later through at a discounted rate. Else I would have not stayed there at all simply on how rude they were on the phone.<br/> 
3759791	 I'm a Platinum member of Holiday Inn's Priority Club. I have 100s of nights stayed in Intercontinal, Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inns. Hamilton provided the WORST service of any Holiday property in recent memory.<br/><br/>When I arrived at Dulles, I called the Hamilton over and over and over. They did not answer the phone. When I finally arrived an hour later, I told the front desk that I couldn't get thru, and he answered &quot;we're too busy to answer the phone&quot;.<br/><br/>TheY DID NOT have my PREPAID GUARANTEED room. They did not have any rollaway beds. In the end, we slept on the floor in a small room that they made available with 1 king bed. And to boot, they arrived at the room at 230AM following all of us being asleep from a cross country flight to deliver sheets and tell us that they had NO BLANKETS.<br/><br/>All in all, I would avoid the Hamilton like the plague. The management was non responsive to the problem and I cancelled a week stay and went to the regular Holiday Inn 2 blocks away where I received much much better treatment.<br/> 
3757629	 I stayed at the Hamilton the first week of July and enjoyed my stay. i was in DC on Business and this was one of choices that I was given. I had a special rate - so i don't know if its prices are reasonable for regular travel.<br/><br/>My room was nice with a large bathroom. i was on the 11th floor so I had to use a key in the elevator. The staff was extremely helpful, especially becasue I had a problem with my credit card. They let me use a private phone to straighten out the issue. The staff was also great with recommendations for food and directions.<br/><br/>i ate in the restaurant downstairs once and the food was good. The dessert was excellent.<br/><br/>I had two free days while in DC and on one day I went to Mt Vernon by way of a cruise ont he Potomac. i recommend going this way in nice weather. it was beautiful and quick. Mt Vernon is a must see!<br/><br/>The other day we did the usual sites - WWII memorial, arlington, national archives, etc. Everyone should do them once (some pictures are attached). Also, I was there during 7/7, so I went to the British Embassy to sign the book of condolences. Afterward, i walked from the embassy to the hotel. it is a long walk, but worth it (I'm a NYer so I am used to walking a lot). i strolled by the embassies and admired their architecture. <br/><br/>Overall, i enjoyed DC and recommend this hotel. It is conveniently located to everything - only blocks to the White House, and major landmarks.<br/> 
3679436	 I proposed to my girlfriend on Saturday evening and surprised her by bringing her back to this hotel rather than going back to my friend's apartment. The room I was assigned to reeked of cigarette smoke (non-smoking room on a non-smoking floor) and was promptly moved to a nicer, smokefree room. The room was very nicely decorated, not your standard floral pattern bedspread. The bathroom was nice, with a new bowed shower curtain rod, making extra room in the shower. The bed was by far the most comfortable I have ever slept in... heavy comforter, tons of pillows, and firm and soft at the same time! Staff was helpful and friendly. It is now our DC hotel and will stay there whenever we visit DC.<br/> 
182727095	 First, the good: impeccable decor, gorgeous lobby, great bar with happy hour, historic charm, excellent location, nice staff. Now, the bad: tiny rooms and loud street noise. We were on the 8th floor, and could hear people laughing in the street below, let alone all the police sirens several times per night, loud bar 1/2 block away, trash trucks at 4:30 a.m., you name it. I wore ear plugs and still couldn't sleep. If you decide to stay here, make sure to get a room away from the front street or anywhere near the bar across the park. We complained to the staff and were told they're trying to get approval to replace their single-paned windows with double-paned ones. Because it's a historic hotel, apparently this is a cumbersome process. 
182696526	 I have stayed here before with no complaints. My last stay just last week was very pleasant up until breakfast.<br/><br/>The entire staff that I encountered were incredibly friendly, helpful and courteous. The room was clean, the temperature was perfect, sometimes you go somewhere where no matter how much you cool it down or try to heat it up the temp is always not quite right. And the relaxation ointments and spray and are nice little bonus. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, too. I was able to take advantage of the breakfast they offered, as well. I'm glad I ate before the dog came in.<br/><br/>I did not realize this was a dog friendly hotel, I don't mind it; I have one myself. And there was no issue in barking either. My issue and complaint is that the dog was allowed into the area where the breakfast was. This is a hotel not someone's home where the pet is allowed to roam free, inclusive of dining/eating areas. I find it very unsanitary. The dog's owner came in with the dog in a carrier (it was small dog), I'm not sure of the breed, but it had long hair and long ears. She kept the carrier on her shoulder as she got plates, utensils, and food for her and her (barefoot) daughter. All the while, the dogs ears were were scraping along the trays that held the silverware and the plates. This is not only disgusting, but very unsanitary. <br/><br/>I was glad I had already eaten; but feel bad for the next group of people coming in, having dog haired silverware and plates. The lady at the breakfast bar should have told her that the dog was to have remained in the room. Also, just like more restaurants have a no shirt, no shoes, no service policy - perhaps this hotel should develop it, as well. I'm not going to critique these people's parenting skills (or lack thereof) but it wasn't appetizing eating while this child ran around barefoot with blackened toe nails. <br/><br/>Unless the policy changes on the dogs allowed in the dining areas, I will reconsider any future stay. 
182163759	 Arriving from the madness of New York, we were so pleasantly surprised at this wonderful historic, mid sized hotel. Being a platinum member our four night stay was on points, not cash, but we were given an amazing room on the top floor and invited to use the VIP lounge for breakfast and cocktails. The room was comfortable with quality furniture and bedding and a great bathroom. There was a good coffee machine with REAL cups, not those ghastly paper monstrosities usually found in American hotels. Evening cocktails were great, and good wine to be had for a steal at $4 a glass. The staff were great, genuinely friendly and helpful. Free and fast wifi in the room and evening turndown. <br/><br/>Would thoroughly recommend the Hamilton. 
182109143	 I stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in downtown D.C. for 4 nights in October 2013. From start to finish I was impressed with how exceptionally friendly and helpful the staff was - from the valet to the front desk to the concierge to housekeeping. The hotel also has a historic charm without seeming dated or worn as is the case for some other hotels that make that claim. And whether you are in town as a tourist or for business, the location is ideal - walking distance to the National Mall and to most downtown law firms etc. Head just a few blocks north on 14th street to get a flavor of the local neighborhoods and restaurants. Also the rooms were dark and the beds comfortable, making for a good nights sleep. 
181940126	 Returned from Crown Plaza two weeks ago very nice hotel and staff are so lovely and helpful,White House National mall etc are all in walking distance,really enjoyed happy hour 5 till 8 when you can get food and drinks at a good price also as the weather was lovely we were able to sit outside in the sunshine ,did not have breakfast in the hotel as there is a Cafe 5 mins walk away good food at half the price,all in all great stay in Crown Plaza and Washington D C 
181788802	 We used to live in DC and would frequently drive past the Crowne Plaza on 14th without stepping inside. And when we had visitors in town, it was never on the top of my list to recommend, since there are so many other better-known hotels in Washington. But for a business trip last week, I had to book at the last minute and found a good rate here -- and took it. It will now be on my list of recommended places for visitors. What a pleasant surprise!<br/><br/>As everyone has noted, the location is excellent: a block from the McPherson Square Metro and close to a lot of good restaurants on the K Street corridor. But it was the large room and boutique hotel-like decor that won me over. My room was very spacious, and it appeared recently renovated -- or at least recently updated with stylish bedding and furniture. Also a large bathroom area.<br/><br/>As others have noted, the WiFi charges are a bit over-the-top. I'm a frequent business traveler, and it was on the high end of what I've payed anywhere in the world. But overall, a very pleasant stay at a chain that I don't usually associate with high-end service and amenities. 
157952470	 Nice hotel room - clean, modern, flat screen tv. Missing a mini bar, but maybe it's just not that class of hotel. However, the $13 for wi-fi is a waste as internet speeds on the hotel's network are slower than a modem dial-up, whether I was in my room or even in the lobby. If they are going to charge $13 a day for wi-fi access, they should have an up to date network and not something they installed before iPhones existed. When I complained about the wi-fi, no offer of refund. Also, on checking out, I mentioned that I took the $5 water bottle in the room. The check out desk told me not to worry about it and smiled. Then I see they banged me for that extra $5 on my credit card. I could probably call them and complain about it and they might refund me, but it's not worth my time and I'd rather call them out in a public forum on their shady business practices to warn others not to get ripped off (for not that much money, but still). Bottom line, nice hotel, and nice location, but the nickel and diming left a bad taste. 
157914824	 Arrived on Friday for the Cherry Blossom Festival parade.<br/><br/>Good: Quick ride from the airport. Beautiful hotel with a lot of charm. The room was gorgeous, very spacious for two and extremely comfortable. We headed out for dinner and everything was within walking distance. It was at that point that I told myself to remember to review the hotel via Trip Advisor. Cabs are plentiful. We were centralized for the weekend events.<br/><br/>Extremely Bad: Check-in took 3 times longer than it should have therefore my BFF and I knew something was not right since everything was already paid in full via Delta Vacations. (I knew I should have move towards Mallory to check us in instead of the person that serviced us.) She told us that nothing would be charged to my credit card since everything was full paid via Delta but a hold would be applied for usuals. (The hold was only supposed to be $75 per night for the one room.) I am used to that but the following day, I discovered 2 separate and odd charges of $307 and $454 on my card. No one could tell me why but alleged the transactions were holds that were done in error. (As I reflected back to the check-in process, I now know why she kept writing something on her pad and keyed my card number in twice.) I spoke to 3 different people and they all sung the same story about the hold and provided apologies. Upon checking out on Sunday, I was assured the only charge that would be applied to my credit card would be my restaurant bill of $27.50. Since I had two receipts (one under my door and one at check out) indicating that would be on the only charge, I actually believed them. Guess what!!! $307 was still charged to my credit card anyway. I spoke with a gentlemen in accounting on Monday. He attempted to try to explain the error and I had to ask him to please stop because his responses did not make sense. If you do not know, just say you do not know instead of trying take up for the person that checked us in. I had an answer for every explanation because there was no reason for the transactions ie..prepaid via Delta, different cards used with Delta versus check-in etc. In todays world of identity theft, I make every attempt to pay in cash when traveling and only use a low credit limit card for scenarios such as this one. What should have been a seamless process has caused an extreme headache plus impacted my trip because of my type A personality. <br/> <br/>What would have been a rating of 5 was downgraded to 3 and I am trying hard to not change it to a 2 before signing off. <br/><br/>Shout out to Matt in 24kt!! You made me smile after discovering the credit card debacle. The mojito was a hit.<br/><br/>I gave a 5 for service because everyone else was absolutely superb and should not be penalized for one person not doing their job correctly.<br/><br/>Robin S.<br/>Atlanta, GA 
157562304	 Comfortable. Modern room. Nice bathroom amenities. Very comfortable beds. Check in was quick. The price was reasonable. Starbucks is next door. Walking distance to all the monuments. Keurig coffee machine in the room. Flat screen TV. Internet is not free. Nice bar. Wines are priced reasonably 
157190470	 The hotel has a superb location, just blocks away from the White House and the Mall. The entrance is beautifully restored and the room we had was very nice and clean. There was no breakfast included in our rate but there is a Starbucks in the hotel. I didn't like the fact that WIFI was 12.50 per day (so we didn't use it). There is a Metrorail stop just across the park that takes you directly to the National Airport. 
157099733	 The room was really clean and tidy up perfectly. The buffet for breakfast was good and full of fresh fruit.<br/>The location is great, really close to the white house.<br/>The negative points were: internet connection at 12.50 USD per day and car parking costs around 50USD per day.<br/>Most of the staff was really friendly and helpful, except that we took almost 1 hour to have the (un)correct invoice. 
157040757	 I recently took a weekend trip to DC for a convention and it was a really nice hotel. I was surprised to see a Kerig and an Ihome docking station in the room! I was booked in a room that was on the 7th fl and faced the street so if your a light sleeper I'd suggest a room in the back of the hotel. Wifi is also not included but there are several cafes and restaurants on the block that do offer this. It is within walking distance to the metro. I flew to Reagan Airport and took the Metro for $3.50 to Mcpherson Sq. I would highly suggest this as the taxi will cost you $16 and they only take cash. The restaurant was a little pricey in the hotel but they do offer Happy Hour during the week. I was able to have some of the best ahi tuna at the bar and it only cost around $8!! The location is excellent as well. I had little time to do tours so I walked to most of the attractions (Lincoln Memorial, White House, Washington Monument). Overall great hotel for location and a weekend stay. 
62592288	 Nice hotel in a good location - only 2 blocks from the White House and easy walk to the Mall, museums, etc. Staff was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and neat, although a bit cramped for 2 adults and 2 kids. Not a ton of restaurants nearby. Was surprised to notice how many restaurants were only open for breakfast and lunch. Overall, this hotel and location were good...I'd recommend it. 
62437191	 We arrived to the hotel Thursday afternoon and were quickly checked in. We were supposed to have a &quot;park view&quot; room, however they upgraded us to a jr suite - which was nice, but had a view of an alley. I think we were happier there, but it was a tiny letdown after being reserved under park view. When we got to the room the key card didn't work, and they came up quickly to fix it - it wasn't completely broken, just old and you had to swipe your room card about 10 times to get into the room. <br/><br/>The room itself was nice. The only drawback was the shower head would not stay in one place, so you had to stand really close to the wall to get a good shower.<br/><br/>The lobby is small, but nicely appointed. Only complaint is the lobby was always very crowded and rather loud morning, noon, and night.<br/><br/>Good location as it was about 4 blocks to the White House, and one block from the Mcpherson Square metro stop which can get you to Metro Center in one or two stops.<br/><br/>We checked out this afternoon, and since checkout time was noon, they agreed to hold our luggage in the cloak room for us until we were ready to leave. A nice touch.<br/><br/>Overall - pricey for what you get. Would have like to get closer to a metro, and explore other DC hotels. They are all a bit pricey, but for more than $200/night, you should get exactly that you want. 
61629970	 We traveled to DC with our two small children and could not have been more pleased with our treatment at The Hamilton. They were very accomodating and considerate of our needs. Visit the bar in the hotel. You will find some excellent bartenders. 
60706803	 We had several issues from not having our checked baggage brought up for 45 minutes even after 3 phone calls, an AC that kept breaking down, a toilet that ran all night, furniture in need of repair, one of the two phones did not work, an electrical outlet in the bathroom for the hair dryer was broken and we found a bottle of pvc glue under the bed (still there). <br/><br/>The location is excellent and the staff tried to be helpful but we were rather disappointed with the hotel. 
60094599	 This hotel is a little gem! Located not far from the White House and is perfectly situated one block from a metro station. It is a lovely historic building that is well maintained inside. Nice bar and restaurant on the ground floor. The rooms are spacious, clean, tidy and nicely decorated. The hotel is reasonably priced too. I would recommend it for pleasure or a business trip. Staff were super friendly and efficient. 
59655243	 I stayed here with some of my friends and was very disappointed. I put my car in valet and used cab's around the city since parking is hard. The next morning when I got my car- the rims were scratched on two of my wheels. It was from rubbing against a curb. I had just bought a brand new car and I knew they were brand new wheels also. The valet manager said that there was &quot;no proof&quot; that they were responsible for the damage. I showed him the paperwork that I just bought the car last week and that it was still shiny from the car wash- also when you give the car to valet- they walk around and see if its in good shape or not. I had no issue at all. When I got the car- you could see there was fresh paint on the tires from being rubbed against a curb. I asked the manager to file a claim in his insurance- he was very apprehensive to do so since his premium would go up but eventually did when i threatened to call the police. I then talked to front desk about the issue and they said the valet service was contracted out so It was not their responsibility. I was furious and I told them that I would talk to corporate because it WAS their responsibility. Eventually the guy from the parking garage called me 2 days later and said &quot;the insurance company denied your claim&quot;. I called him back right away and he never answered. Luckily- the damage to my car was only $350 but I refuse to ever stay there again. VERY BAD SERVICE and not willing to even work with you. 
4244344	 I arrived at the hotel around 1:30pm and was given my room immediately even though checkin was not until 3. The room was beautifully decorated like a very expensive home. The bed was extremely comfortable with a soft duvet and excellent quality linens. Everthing was immaculate. The room was on the interior of the hotel so there was no street noise (I had requested a quiet room). The location was perfect for my meeting two blocks away. It is also near the subway and within walking distance of the White House. The staff was courteous and they stored my luggage after I checked out until I could return from my meeting.<br/><br/> 
4131059	 I stayed over the weekend with my fiance and pet, We were told they could not honor our king size bed request because we had a dog and therefore banished to the third floor (only floor were pets are allowed)and there were no king size beds available on this floor. We were then changed to a room with two beds..much better.I felt that because we had a pet all our request were automatically invalid. The rooms are a litte outdated and do not have sufficient lighting. we had a view of the a/c unit outside. The parking is extremely expensive and $28/night you can try your luck at finding a parking meter space right next to the hotel building for $O/night (free) after 6:30p.m area is safe but there is not much to do(dining/cafes) after dark/weekends virtually everything is closed down and only open during business hours 9-5p.m<br/> 
4100075	 The hotel was very nice. I really enjoyed my stay. The rooms were clean and decorated nicely. I would def come back. Everything was in walking distance.<br/> 
4092549	 After a mechanical failure caused the luggage door on our plane to stay closed for an hour after we had disembarked, we arrived at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza tired and hungry -- well past 1 am. The night audit manager was so nice and warm when we arrived. My husband asked if he had any good rooms available, and he said he would take care of us and put us in a very nice room. We had no idea how nice it would be!!<br/><br/>We were on the top floor (14 -- apparently an &quot;executive floor&quot;) with a view of 14th street, the entire city, and the Washington Monument. The room was spacious, had a printer for our laptops, and the whole front wall in our room was windows. Beautiful bathroom with granite countertops, plush robe, and fluffy towels. There were also little extras such as an eye mask, earplugs, linen spray, and a nature CD to fall asleep by. <br/><br/>All of the staff were helpful, always opening doors, greeting you, telling you to have a good evening, or giving you tips on how to get to places more quickly.<br/><br/>We were stunned by the view from our room and fell asleep each night with the curtains pulled as far back as they would go, a breathtaking view of the city right in front of us. The bed was sooooooooo comfy, and I cannot say enough great things about this hotel, it's staff, and the location. (Only 4 blocks from the White House!!!) I didn't want to leave but will definitely go back!<br/> 
4044238	 For $239/night + tax, we got a rel. small room (10th floor), noisy (near the elevators), internet connection box (attention for those with non-wireless laptops) was available only from the 3rd day and after several phone calls (!), rather small bathroom, overall clean room. This was the second room they gave us, we asked once to change it (TV set had unusual location in the room). Otherwise, relatively decent hotel.<br/> 
3916238	 We just returned from an 8 night stay at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza. <br/>We were very happy with our choice in hotels. Got a good rate with the &quot;Entertainment Card&quot; -- $100 Fri-Sun, $150 Mon-Thur for an &quot;Executive Room&quot;. With this, on weekdays we also received a continental breakfast and evening open bar with appetizers and desserts served in a &quot;club area&quot; on our floor. The hotel is in a great location, just a block north of a Metro Station. There is a park across the street with a lot of homeless people, but never bothered us the many, many times we walked by day or night -- didn't even come within 20 feet of us. We were able to walk a lot of places. Had no problems with finding restaurants in the area, even on the weekends. The rooms were a little smaller than what I thought an &quot;executive room&quot; would be, but it sounds like that is very typical for the older hotels. But the room was fine for two people for our long stay. Bathroom was nice -- granite, etc. AND--the beds--the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. I even pulled back the sheets to find out what kind of bed it was. Everyone at the hotel was very friendly. They let us check in early (before noon) and have a late check out. I never went to the bar or restaurant - so I can't comment about that. I would absolutely stay here again.<br/> 
122383737	 Travelzoo had this hotel deal for $89/night. I was a little hesitant after booking it because I read some of the reviews afterwards (ok, I admit I did it backwards). We stayed 12/25/11 - 12/30/11 and booked an executive king room. The executive includes free continental breakfast buffet and newspaper each morning. When we checked in, we asked for a quiet room and they assigned us room 1439 which is on the top floor overlooking K St and Franklin Park with the Washington monument in the distance.<br/><br/>The only noise that I would bring to your attention is from a club on 14th St, about a 1/2 a block down and across the street. I don't believe I heard the club's music itself. What I believe I heard was the music from the cars lined up outside the club. The noise was not continuously noticeable. I'm a lighter sleeper but had no problem sleeping through it. My boyfriend said he didn't hear anything.<br/><br/>As some have said, the room is on the small side which we expected since it is an historic hotel. Unlike a mega hotel, the walk from the elevator to the room was short.even though our room was at the end of a hall. The furnishings and room in general were in very good condition. It did have a flat screen TV, excellent heater, and more than normal number of electrical outlets (for all the chargers for our electronics). Plenty of water pressure and the hot water was almost immediate. Bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. The soap and shampoo weren't overly perfumey like some hotels have. Rooms do not have fridges or microwaves, but do have coffee makers, irons, and hair dryers.<br/><br/>Though the hotel says the internet is for a fee, if you have AT&amp;T internet at home (such as through AT&amp;T Uverse), there is an option as you access the Crowne Plaza wifi for you to use it as an existing AT&amp;T internet customer for free. Your home internet plan has to include the AT&amp;T wi-fi hotspot feature before you can get this.<br/><br/>All the staff were very courteous, professional and helpful. All the elevators were working and we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes for an elevator during the whole week. The elevators are small - max 8 people.<br/><br/>We had dinner at the 14K restaurant on Christmas and it was very good - I had the tuna and he had the sea bass. The free continental breakfasts were sufficient to start our day - coffee, juice, pastries, bagels, toast, assorted fruits, assorted cereals, and yogurt. For an additional $7 you can upgrade your continental buffet to the breakfast buffet which includes omelets, waffles, sausage, eggs, bacon, potatoes, etc.<br/><br/>Great location - 1 block from the McPherson Metro entrance. It only costed $1.80 one way on the Metro on the non-rush-hour times to the National Mall. The blue and orange lines took us directly to the Mall. On 12/26, our first day of sight-seeing, we walked to the White House, Renwick Gallery and then along the southeast side of the mall (Smithsonian Castle, Hirschhorn Museum, etc.). From their we walked up 7th street Chinatown for dinner and then back to the hotel. Though we're not hikers or in any great shape, the walk was not strenuous. There are plenty of places to stop and sit along the way.<br/><br/>Note: it appears Occupy Washington (tents) may be inhabiting McPherson Square Park.Saw quite a few tents, but no people. McPherson is a block away and can't be seen from the Hamilton. I did see 2 or 3 homeless folks during the week around the Hamilton, but nothing I worried about.<br/><br/>FYI, there's a Five Guys hamburger joint at the top of the McPherson Metro entrance. There's a few restaurants within a block or two of the hotel. There's a post office, Fedex, CVS Pharmacy, and liquor store within a block.<br/><br/>Thanks very much Hamilton Crowne Plaza for a very enjoyable stay!<br/>Diana &amp; Larry 
122260023	 This hotel was dirty in the bathrooms, their restaurant was dirty. The noise outside from the vast amounts of homeless people is so difficult to sleep through. I would not stay there again. 
122233351	 This is the hotel to stay at while in washington DC. The location is great, close to everything. <br/>To say the staff is excellent is an understatement. Everyone makes you feel welcome, and will make sure you are comfortable during you stay. the knowledge of the local area is great. I needed a part for my computer and they knew right where to send me.<br/>The room is showing its wear a bit and needs remodeling. you do have to pay for the internet, but this is normal for most high hotels. 
122148058	 I would love this to be a rave review because the staff was wonderful, the room was lovely and the location was great, but unfortunately the noise factor trumps everything else. Barely slept for two nights! Won't be back, and will think twice about booking other Crown hotels. 
121945120	 I've stayed at this property numerous times over the last few years, but my recent trip in the last few days will be my last.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if it is the harsh economic times in the US or just the hotel is being a victim of its own success and the owners are being greedy.<br/><br/>Check in was warm and welcoming. But there was a sting in the tail. I was told that the internet, which in the past had been complimentary was now chargeable. I don't seem to recall seeing that in the booking parts on the website. And being in the highest tier of the loyalty program and having booked an Executive Room didn't make any difference.<br/><br/>I was also told that the Executive lounge was open, which it hadn't been on my previous visits and I had been given vouchers for drinks and breakfast. So you can imagine my surprise to find that the lounge wasn't in fact serving breakfast or drinks. Very disappointing - what is the point in booking an Executive Room if you don't get the perks? I eventually was given some breakfast vouchers but no apology for not being given them in the first place.<br/><br/>Speaking of perks, again being an elite member of Priority Club program, didn't result in a room upgrade. It was a nice enough room on the top floor overlooking the park (maybe that counts as an upgrade being on the top floor?) If you like sunny rooms then high up on this side will give you plenty of that. I know that room upgrades are subject to availability, but Hilton does a much better job in telling you if you have been upgraded and if you haven't offering you something in return, But more of that later.<br/><br/>The hotel restaurant and staff, were, however, excellent. The Chef, George Lopez, came out and talked with my guests and explained the food which was a real nice touch. They also had a great deal on with a free (excellent) bottle of house wine with two main courses. Can't rate all of that highly enough. The rest of the staff around the hotel were very friendly too.<br/><br/>One thing that will impact you if you staff here, and rather confirms my view of margin maximisation on the management's behalf, are the lifts/elevators. Expect to wait an eternity for them even when the place isn't busy (it was my perception that it wasn't busy during my stay.) And expect to be packed in when it is busy.<br/><br/>There were only two working out of four and this was similar to my last visit in September. Can't see why it would take so long to fix them - granted an old building but refurbished a few years ago.<br/><br/>I've brought considerable business to this hotel over the last couple of years. Not just my own stays but numerous other colleagues who have stayed there and eaten in the restaurant and spent money in the bar. The staff there are all excellent. However, there are better value hotels in DC, where you'll get complimentary internet and faster lifts/elevators.<br/><br/>I know I'll be voting with my feet and my wallet. It isn't that I can't afford the internet cost but I feel I was mislead on so many fronts and that the hotel failed to deliver its side of the deal. Hilton here I come....... 
121796182	 We stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza for a short sight seeing weekend and were pleasantly surprised by how convenient the location was. We could walk to all the main tourist attractions and we were also a stone's throw away from some decent clubs. The room was small but well formed and clean with traditional decor. The food in the restaurant was excellent. Be sure to check out happy hour downstairs in the bar area - prices are reasonable and the finger food delicious! 
209995870	 Stayed at this hotel last month. The location is great, only short walk to the White House. The staff is outstanding and I have to mention the Concierge who gave me an outstanding service. The room I got was spacious and beautyfuland had everything you might need beside WiFi!!! I was told that the hotel offered a WiFi but in my room I didn't reach any connection. I asked for another room and that was no problem at all. The elevators worked fine. The restaurant was good and the bar is nice. The breakfast was good but not included in the price.<br/>Rather expencive hotel but great location and great staff. 
209899290	 Just came back from a 3 day trip to DC. The staff at this hotel did everything to make our stay fantastic. Anthony Brown, Concierge, was so warm and caring. He truly made us feel like we were family. All of his recommendations were spot on. The servers at breakfast were very helpful. One thing to note, if you have breakfast included in your room, you can order eggs to order (even an omelette) since the eggs on the buffet were very over cooked. Fruit was delicious and so was coffee. Don't miss Siroc Italian restaurant. Very close to hotel. Delicious food and reasonable prices. 
209645643	 If you are an IHG Platinum Club member I would recommend staying at a different hotel. This property does not have a lounge and does not have a complimentary breakfast for Platinum members. You can get a better value at other IHG properties in the DC area. 
209050291	 The hotel was very awesome and customer service was outstanding. Tony Brown was the most amazing concierge that I have ever meet. He was very helpful and sent us to the best restaurants in DC and made sure the experience was over the top. I would stay here again when I'm ever in DC again. 
208590631	 I found the staff really helpful. The room was quite small but really comfy beds. The bathroom was nice but I was expecting a more powerful shower. Despite facing the road it was not too noisy. Easy walk to the White House and museums. Breakfast was expensive but good. Happy hour was a godsend. <br/>If I return to Washington I will definitely stay there again<br/>Only negative was the cost of parking and considering the cost. I would have expected free wifi 
208490160	 I have stayed around this hotel in the past and have frequently attended events but it was my first stay. Overall, I found the service excellent but the hotel a little lacking as far as typical business travel amenities.<br/><br/>The papers are delivered a little late and the only choice the ubiquitous and generally useless USA Today. That wouldn't be too bad but their cable system doesn't carry CNBC (although it does have Bloomberg). I did do down and ask for a paper and they were very helpful in finding one and even got at least a Washington Post since they did not have a WSJ.<br/><br/>The restaurant is pretty good for breakfast. I went through the buffet and my eggs were cold when I got back to my table but they were very helpful and made me a batch to order to rectify the situation.<br/><br/>Having to swipe a key in the elevator every time, regardless of time of day is a bit of a pain when you are coming back and forth between meetings.<br/><br/>The internet worked well and was relatively fast for a hotel service. 
102674677	 The hotel is a bit older, but it's been tastefully renovated. Everything inside is clean, there's a bar inside with a hotel. The staff was helpful and pleasant. The hotel is located next to absolutely everything. It's a 5 minute walk to the white house and two minutes to the subway. The only downfall that we found was in the windows. It doesn't look like they're good insulators against noise...at night with all the honking and ambulances it can get a bit bothersome. Otherwise we had a good time.<br/><br/>Rooms weren't huge, but then again..why do you need a giant room? We had plenty of space. Didn't use their internet because we both had smart phones. 
101894725	 The whole story started in the afternoon. The manger named Walter E. called me with the information that my credit card has been declined. I told him that the credit card which I used for the reservation was not valid any more; however, they swiped my current credit card when I checked in. I told him – and he agreed - that I will bring my new credit card when I go for an evening walk. He gave me time till 11:30 PM to do it. <br/><br/>Around 5:30 PM I left my room to go the club for the evening snack. When I wanted to come back, my room key card did not work. I went to the front desk and asked Mr. E asking for a new key card. He refused to do it and insisted that I have to give him first my credit card. I explained that I left my room only for a short stay at the club and did not have the credit card on me. Nevertheless, he insisted that I have to give him first the credit card before he can let me into my room. I identified myself as a platinum member with the Priority Club and Intercontinental Ambassador. Again, he wanted to have my credit card before letting me into my room. I asked to speak with his manager; however, he insisted that he is in charge. Finally, he proposed that the security or he himself would escort me into my room for my credit card. I refused to be escorted into the room as a common criminal or a prisoner under hotel security. After at least 45 min very stressful conversation he issued a room key for me, so I was able to return to my room. <br/><br/>I just could not believe the way I was treated in that hotel, especially as a platinum member of the Priority Club. I felt that the personnel of this hotel treated me as a criminal. I never experienced a similar or equally stressful situation in any hotel, even the cheapest motel. I advice you to avoid this hotel and - especially - the front desk manager named Walter E. I do not plan to make any other reservation with the Priority Club chain (Holiday Inn, Crown Plaza, or Intercontinental). I am now switching completely to the Starwood or Hilton Hotels, which are usually in nicer location, much nicer, and the personnel is much better trained. 
101256195	 Stayed for a night in June - sorry to take so long to review. Everyone was very friendly and the staff was great. Being a priority club member we received a free beer in the bar which was very nice. Ray is the AGM and he made our stay great!! The location is great and very close to everything in DC. Would recommend to anyone!! 
100629181	 Trading as a business hotel, it was fully booked for the nights i stayed.<br/>staff great - but i was on the second floor at the front corner - avoid these rooms - all are very small and extremely noisy.Very expensive for what you get.<br/>Priority club members - note you have to select either free wifi or half price breakfast - not both.<br/>Try for a high floor and ask for a larger room. 
100198922	 We recently stayed at the Hamilton Crowne Plaza in DC and overall we were pleased with our stay. We chose the hotel because it is one of the few pet friendly hotels in DC that was convenient to the Verizon Center and in our price range. <br/><br/>While they are pet friendly, they charge a $250 fee which is refunded at the end of your stay provided there was no damage. This was fine with me as I knew our dog wouldn't do any damage. I also found it interesting that they just asked us at the end of the stay if she did. Perhaps because we inquired about the fee, otherwise, I assume they figure if they don't hear about damage from the housekeeping staff then there must not be any.<br/>We booked the &quot;Weekend with Parking&quot; deal online for $154 per night. A few days before we left we saw that is was advertising for $114 per night. We called and asked if they would honor that price and they did (though we had to remind them at check in). Doing the weekend with parking deal made sense because they charge $35 for valet parking per night. So booking with the deal at the original price made parking $19 a night instead, then with the final price - it ended up being a steal! Being informed pays - this is the first place the extra fees could have bitten us - I heard our room neighbor cursing when he found out how much they were charging for parking.<br/><br/>The room was nice - a little small, but nice overall with updated features and a large bed. Our room had the park view, but because of the way the desk was situated, you couldn't easily look out the window on to the park. Not only that, but the park was filled with homeless people during the day (not so much at night). When walking our dog several of them yelled at me and then another group called my boyfriend a &quot;white motherf***er!&quot; and screamed at him asking him how he would feel if he was on a leash like our dog. That was not so pleasant, but the hotel can't control who is in the park. Just something to know about if you bring a pet since this is the only area really to walk them. <br/><br/>One major downer, and clearly something I missed the fine print on, was that there was no free Internet at the hotel. You had to pay $12.95 per 24 hours to get online. Such a rip-off! I can't believe they do that, it just seems ridiculous that in 2011 we would have to pay for Internet on top of the room charge. If it was something like $5 a day, that would be more understandable. Unfortunately, we planned to use the Internet to figure out where to eat and directions and all that, so we had to pay $26 just to use the Internet during our stay. I found this very annoying.<br/><br/>Our room was quaint, but not very sound proof, you could hear everything in the hallway, the elevator dinging, people talking, doors slamming, etc. This bothered me as I am a very light sleeper, and also it worried me that it might cause our dog to bark or cry while we were not in the room. There was also no refrigerator and the coffee maker was stored in the bathroom - I thought that was gross and we didn't end up using it.<br/><br/>Every person from the staff was very friendly, that was a definite plus of our stay! There is a restaurant on the grounds, 14K, but we did not ever eat there.<br/><br/>All in all, I would stay here again as the rates are competitive, it's pet friendly, and we could walk to everywhere we wanted to. (It was a bit of a trek to some areas of the city, the McPherson metro stop looks close to the hotel - so that is an option for people who don't want to walk). There is also a CVS right up the road that is open 24 hours. Buy your water and drinks there (don't accidentally drink the $2.95 bottle of water they leave in the room or buy something from the vending machine - our soda was warm). 
96515634	 I stayed at The Hamilton for two nights on business. While the location is great, there are plenty of hotels in this area, so find the one that's right for you. Although it's only a 15 minute walk from the Washington Convention Center where my conference took place, there are other hotels closer to that site. The neighborhood is definitely a hot night spot with packed bars and clubs.<br/><br/>I paid $184/night with AAA and stayed in a &quot;king executive&quot; I signed up for the hotel's reward card (Priority Club) and was given a choice of free wifi or two other perks (maybe free valet?) that I couldn't use. I took the free wifi. I wish I had known about the women's floor - I would have taken advantage of that.<br/><br/>Bottom line: check out the other local hotel deals, but there's no reason not to stay here. 
79845298	 Crowne Plaza Washington, located at 14th / K street is just a short walk away from the White House, the Mall and the Capitol. Metro's just a block away and the bus to exciting Georgetown is in front of the door. As a Starbucks store is in the house and even provides room charge, the infrastructure could not be better. The hotel itself is located in a historic buildung. The lobby is restored nicely while the rooms are refurbished and comfortable. As upgraded due Platinum status in Priority Club we got a suite for an unbeatable rate, which was an outstanding value. The suite was modern and nicely furnished. Most of the staff were helpful and nice. The staff in the restaurant 14k, where we had complimentary breakfast was not as professional as extected. Large groups and plenty of guest led to slow service. That might be improved by the management. Parking is 34 $ for valet and the charges for internet are 12,95 $. In my eyes internet charges in the US are not state of the art and should be removed. All in all, nice stay 
79163832	 I've stayed at the Hamilton for business and decided to take my girlfriend for a few days to site see. We had a great time and the hotel was fantastic. We got in very early on Wednesday morning, yet they still let us check-in and bring our bags to our room. I'll definitely be back again. 
78845381	 We enjoyed my stay here. My sole purpose was to see the memorials and monuments and this was the perfect location. Everyone I encountered was extremely polite and helpful not to mention accommodating...I had to check out by 12pm but my car was able to stay in their garage until 5pm - that helped a ton. I will say room was just a tad small and there were a few cosmetic repairs needed but all in all this was a great hotel. I will definitely consider staying here again in the future.<br/><br/>had a Starbucks - huge plus! 
78552786	 Stayed for 3 nights over Labor Day weekend. Check-in was fast and friendly. Room was clean and basic. No problems during the stay. The value of the hotel was good. We paid less than $100 on hotwire and were very satisfied with what we got for the price.<br/><br/>The location was good in that it was in town, but wish it would have been a bit closer to the metro train. Not a big deal, but it would have been nice. It was definitely better than staying outside the city. We rode from airport to McPherson stop on metro, but thought that the Metro Center was the better place to grab the train (few blocks straight south on 12th).<br/><br/>Did not utilize the pool, exercise room or restaurant. Did check with doorman services about a trolley tour I was interested in. He wanted to sell me what he was offering which was not what I wanted, and wasn't overly helpful in selling something else. I guess that's to be expected. The hotel did have a small gift shop with some snacks and souvenirs. <br/><br/>My wife and I were both satisfied and would stay here again. 
76116993	 Every thing was just ok. My family and I walked in and were greeted by a outgoing man, who quickly tried to help us and our service needs. We got to our room put our stuff down and left. After getting back I turned on the tv and it did not work, thats fine with me as long as I had my internet but loo and behold I was first to pay $13 for it. So I thought maybe they would give me something for the nonworking tv like a $5 show, movie, or internet they flatout said no. this problem has happening for four days and no fix. 
75426029	 Our stay at the Crowne Plaza Hamilton was ok. Nothing particularly bad about it, but I'd choose a different hotel next time. I expect more from a Crowne Plaza. The hotel itself is a neat historic hotel with plenty of great architectural details. And the location is nice - near the Metro, close to the White House, etc. It isn't a good location for restaurants and things in the evenning though - more of a business area. But because the Metro is close, it is easy to go to other places for dinner and drinks. The bar and restaurant in the hotel are good, if pricey. Breakfast was very good and Intercontinental Priority Club members get 1/2 off. <br/><br/>The issues I had with the hotel were:<br/>1. They tried to charge us a higher room rate than the rate we booked. Fortunately I had the confirmation letter so they honored the rate that I booked. They were nice enough about it, but it took a long time to sort it out. <br/>2. The elevators only worked intermitently and were very slow - we took the stairs a lot.<br/>3. The bathroom was very small and there wasn't an alternate place to get ready - very little counter space in the bathroom and no vanity or anything outside the bathroom where someone could put on make up or anything. <br/>4. The matresses and bed linens were just ok.<br/>5. No full-length mirror.<br/>6. Lighting in the room was poor.<br/>7. The digital signal on the TV was bad so we could only watch a few channels. <br/>8. Our room had 1 window, but it faced a wall.<br/><br/>Basically, there were a lot of little things that made the stay sub-par. I just expect more from a Crowne Plaza. 
82436622	 The hotel's location is perfect--we walked everywhere on our trip, from the National Mall to Chinatown. We never felt unsafe and there's great restaurants in the near vicinity. There's a park across the street, but it is home to many of the area's homeless, so it many not be a place where everyone would like to spend a lot of time.<br/>The architecture of the hotel is beautiful and the lobby interior is just gorgeous--the hotel is a member of the Historic Hotels of America. The staff was helpful and very polite. <br/>I had read past reviews about the rooms being very small, so I was a bit nervous when we checked in, But, our particular room (standard King) was perfectly spacious for my husband and I, not to mention clean. Though we did hear some noise from the street, it wasn't as bad as I'd read about from other reviewers and mostly was from sirens every now and then. We both slept well (even my husband, who is a very light sleeper). I would have liked the rooms to have had a bit more unique charm to them (like the lobby), but that's no big deal in the long run. <br/>We arrived late the first night &amp; just ordered room service. The food from the restaurant 14K was delicious (a bit pricey, but it is downtown D.C.) and room service was fast. The lobby bar was a really great place to unwind after a day of sightseeing or to grab a drink before dinner.<br/> I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Note that we got a deal from Priceline for $100/night, so it was a great price. I would definitely check into what discounts are available before spending a lot! Also, the parking is pricey ($30 a night) - keep that in mind when booking! 
82006517	 The hotel staff not friendly, compared to other hotels. <br/>The room was not great for the amount that we paid for. 
81954372	 If you want a lower price than most hotels in DC, then go here. The problem is that the price of the room does not include parking (which is valet only and $36), breakfast is not included ($18 for the buffet per person), and Internet is not included.<br/><br/>Basically, you'll pay almost $200 for the room, parking, and breakfast without Internet if you need it. So, might as well go with the hotel that includes these services. 
81670592	 The one thing was a dirty toilet. It didn't ruin our stay because the service, room, and location made up for it. Loved that it was in the heart of town. The room was a tad small but to be expected of an old building. The staff were very courteous and the restaurant has the best quiche and french toast for breakfast. 
81537884	 It is a good location for sightseeing. The walk isnt easy but it is doable and the cab would be about $10 to the national mall. <br/>there are some good bars and clubs very close to the hotel in the evenings.<br/><br/>The hotel itself is quite pleasant and definately one of the better crowne plazas I have visited. Staff are courteous and helpfull and the starbucks on the ground floor is convenient for morning coffee (although there is also a machine in the room)<br/><br/>The club rooms are tastefull and there is some interesting information on the previous uses of this historic building 
81121809	 Stayed at the Hamilton for business and conference. Great friendly staff, comfortable rooms, good location to all of DC(via metro). Should be top 5 choices for any business traveler doing business in downtown DC. 
152914843	 I travel to Dc at least 6 times a year. It's always great to see Ravi.. I know he has thousands of guests but somehow he always seems to remember my name!! He's a 10 , his attention to details are Unbelievable.. and the way his staff operates and follows Protocol goes to shows what a great team they have!! I've been from the ritz to the four season. This place is ALWAYS The Best ! From the beautiful decorated rooms to the location!! If you want to see Dc and impress your date this is the place to be!! We bring our three kids down with us and we always find something new to do. From a frequent traveler I give Ravi and the team an A+. See you guys soon! 
152609531	 After traveling for 3 weeks we finally arrived at a great hotel. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. The rooms are very well appointed and the bed is so comfy<br/>Plenty of restaurants nearby and central to all attractions<br/> 
152486734	 Stayed here for one night, room is nice but really tiny. Two people with baby and some luggage hardly fit, room has no fridge (is it a five star hotel?) a very very little cabinet that can fit some jacket, no more than this. Room has a cosy feeling however. Asked the front desk, they told me they gave me one of the biggest rooms already! <br/>What is totally anachronistic is the Internet connection, you pay for it 12 usd something (and ok, even though a great number of hotels do not charge anymore I can pay) but they also charge for every single device. So if you travel like nowadays people do, a couple, a computer, each one has an iPad, an iPhone, and you want to connect/update something this can cost you dearly. I find it a quite blind policy from management as a connection should be enclosed in the room's price, firstly, and under these terms I will not come back next time but choose other hotels where I can feel more at ease, including my information needs. And they do this for 12 miserable dollars. 
152302348	 First, the good points. The rooms are nicely decorated. The staff is extremely helpful. In particular, Lewis--the concierge--is very professional and eager to provide advice. In addition, as others have mentioned, the location is central, and it is easy to get everywhere. (It was somewhat off-putting that we saw rats running out of the park across the street when we walked by it, but apparently rats are common throughout D.C.; it's not the hotel's fault.) <br/><br/>Now to the negatives. We requested a quiet room, and we were put in a very small connecting room. When someone checked into the room next door, we could hear EVERY word from him. We complained to the front desk, and they were helpful about changing us quickly. However, it did mean that we had to pack and unpack again. The first room had a safe that didn't work, and hot water that didn't seem very hot. The second room was bigger and faced the inner courtyard, which made it relatively quiet. It had some housekeeping issues, including a dirty window and dust. One day when we returned to the room, a man's tee-shirt that didn't belong to us was sitting on the chair. <br/><br/>In addition, as others have mentioned, it seems ridiculous to charge $12.95 a day for the Internet. 
151814186	 This is a nice hotel nestled in the heart of Washington DC. It dates back to the 1920s and has plenty of history about it. The rooms have been nicely updated and are quite comfortable with nice amenities including flat panel TVs, quality water pressure and shower heads. The hotel downstairs has a great menu. On a working evening when I realized I wouldn't be able to get out to dinner I found myself ordering room service of ginger braised chilean sea bass and gluten-free chocolate cake.<br/><br/>The location is directly north of Franklin Park, the location where Alexander Graham Bell made his first &quot;phone call&quot; and a couple blocks from the White House and the Federal Triangle.<br/><br/>While I appreciated these amenities, I found a couple of issues that impact my desire to stay here again:<br/>1. For nearly $300 a night, one would think that wi-fi would be included in the room price, but alas, no. I could get internet for an additional $12.95 per day.<br/>2. The rooms at the front of the hotel, where I stayed, is susceptible to a lot of street noise. During my last night at the hotel I was awoken at 2:30am by the obnoxious police car sirens that were catty-corner from the hotel. The police siren went off for nearly 10 minutes; when I looked outside I saw about 20 people scrambling from the front of a shop. Needless to say, after 10 minutes of that, I couldn't get back to sleep. Regardless of how nice the bed was...if I can't stay in it, what does it matter.<br/><br/>I would stay here again due to location, but only if I can get a room on a higher floor away from the street. 
151322267	 It was my first time staying at this historic hotel. I was a little concerned about getting there from the airport since I had to fly into Dulles but the Washington Flyer combined w/the Orange Line Metro put me one block away from the Hamilton. Super easy! The staff was very friendly and helpful during my two day stay even welcoming me back at the end of the day. My room was quiet, clean, and updated. There was a single-serve Keurig coffee machine, a nice flat screen tv and the bathroom had all the amenities one would expect plus one add nicety - a magnifying mirror which is very helpful in putting on make up or plucking eyebrows, slippers, and a robe.<br/>Just a short walk to the White House and other sites, I would definitely return to this very conveniently located hotel.
